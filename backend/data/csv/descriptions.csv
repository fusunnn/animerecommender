His sense of morals is lax at best, but he is quick to find the moral flaws of others, which he keeps recorded in his ""Book of Threats"" or ""Devil\'s Handbook"", and uses this information to blackmail everyone from students to figures of authority into placing him in a position of power. He has little respect for authority and has in fact usurped authority over Deimon High School well before the series begins and know authority of a vice principal, using his power in the school to give himself beyond-perfect scores in all his classes and divert funds to the American football club as he desires. Besides blackmail, Hiruma can often intimidate others into taking the action he wants by waving around his vast arsenal of firearms. Even without having to take direct action, Hiruma\'s mere reputation is enough in some instances to make the majority of the student body fear him and bow to his authority. \n\nDespite his penchant for blackmail and breaking seemingly every school rule without consequence, Hiruma adheres to the rules of American football without exception while playing. Inagaki says that Hiruma ""does everything else to win"" and is ""only concerned with winning."" Instead, Hiruma attempts to throw opposing teams off guard through taunts and insults. Even when Hiruma expresses excitement or happiness, he does so in a violent manner, by firing his large guns into the air or kicking a teammate in the rear when they have executed well on a play.   He addresses all members of the Deimon Devil Bats with a vulgar manner, beginning with ""Fucking"" and ending with a descriptive noun, such as ""Shorty"" for Sena or ""Monkey"" for Monta. Some characters, such as Kid, have observed that Hiruma\'s attitude and even aspects of his demonic appearance are an act to intimidate his opponents both on and off the field. Over time, the series has alluded to Hiruma\'s \'true\' personality, which Sena and Mamori Anezaki have at times been shown to understand to some degree, as when one or the other correctly observes Hiruma to be worried, happy, or tired. In addition to these instances, Hiruma has shown compassion to others, though he continues to hide it with his demonic behavior —allowing Takami some privacy after a loss is one such instance. In addition, some of Hiruma\'s actions imply that he cares for the other members of the team more than he lets on. \n\n~!In the case of his two oldest teammates, Hiruma abandoned Shinryuuji High to join Kurita at Deimon High when Kurita failed to gain entrance into the school, and he forbid Musashi\'s kicking tee from being touched after Musashi had to leave the team, making it an almost sacred object in the Devil Bats\' locker room.

In the anime, however, he does not rejoin the team until the game with the Bando Spiders. He has a running rivalry with the kicker of the Spiders Sasaki Koutaro who, according to Hiruma, has never missed. Musashi has an incredibly strong right leg which helps the Devil Bats on kickoffs, often pinning their opponents deep or forcing them to down the ball deep in their own territory, or in their end zone for a touchback. The title of the 60-yard Magnum was actually a lie fabricated by Hiruma, in order to make Musashi seem invincible, and Musashi keeps telling people that it is a lie. The kanji in Musashi\'s last name, Takekura, can also be read as Musashi, thus his nickname. The name is derived from Miyamoto Musashi, a famous samurai, who was famous for his skills with two swords, which relates to the fact that Musashi must put up two kicks for every successful possession (extra point kick or field goal and the kick off).

He also has the habit of attaching \'Max\' to nearly everything he does (suffixing his phrases with MAX! in the Japanese, and prefixing them with MAXI-! in the English), since he believes that one should give 100% effort in all endeavors.

Monta does not know that Joe Montana is a quarterback, not a wide receiver. Monta has a crush on Mamori.

He eventually returns in about a year\'s time, and Morita\'s friends finally discover what he does for his work, being awarded best CGI in the Mocademy Awards (a spoof of the Academy Awards) for the movie \'Space Titanic\', after studying with acclaimed director Peter Lucas.

She is 18 years of age at the beginning of the series and her appearance is that of a child, and she conveniently behaves as one. Raised in a largely sheltered and obscure home by her irritable grandmother, her sociability is below average. It is whilst living in that home that Hagu develops her skill in drawing and painting, her only past-time, though she finds nothing to sketch save for the never-changing view she has from her porch, varying only in seasons. Hagu is from Azumino city, Nagano-ken.   ~! She is introduced to Takemoto, Morita and Mayama by Shūji, her mother\'s cousin and also a professor at the college. Upon seeing her, Morita and Takemoto fall in love with her, though both express it in different ways. Hagu knows not of their feelings towards her, but sees them as friends. However, Morita expresses his love for her in very odd ways, and Hagu is often seen trying to escape from whatever shenanigan Morita has planned for her. Though later Hagu develops feelings towards Morita, although she does not at first realize this, as Shūji points out.  Hagu is very shy, and because she is so nervous when interacting with people, the other art students think that she is strange. Hagu doesn\'t seem to be too close with family members either, with the exception of Shūji, whom she fondly calls ""Shū-chan"". However, as the series progresses, Hagu is able to become closer friends with Takemoto, Mayama, Morita and Yamada. When Shūji leaves to go do a research project in Mongolia, Hagu forms a deeper bond with each of them, essentially seeing them as a sort of family. Hagu lives with Yamada (whom she calls ""Ayu"") when Shūji is away and they become very close friends.  During parties, she is seen to be crying because of her envy of Yamada\'s beautiful legs and beautiful breasts. Mayama tries very hard to comfort her but failing rather miserably saying that ""You\'ll have one of those when you\'re older....probably"". While Hagu is crying, Morita is also crying because of her infectious tears.  Later in the series, Hagu started to avoid Takemoto after he confessed his feelings for her, leaving doubts if his love for her is reciprocated or not. In the latest manga chapters she admits that she likes Morita, but would rather be with Shūji because she knows that he can take care of her (especially after a life-altering accident that may permanently impair her abilities as an artist). !~', 'gender': 'Female', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Yuuta'}, 'description': ' __Height__: 170 cm (5\'7"")\n\nYuuta Takemoto is a second-year student at the art college. He is from Annaka city, Gunma-ken. He lives in the same apartment complex as Mayama and Morita in room 202. His floormates are Morita and Hasegawa. Takemoto studies architecture, but has little certainty as to what he wishes to do upon graduating; his decision to attend art college was because he liked to build things with his hands, like he had with his father.  Takemoto is one of the more mellow characters in the series. He falls in love with Hagu immediately after being introduced by his professor and keeps his feelings to himself throughout most of the series. His love for Hagu and his inability to act upon his feelings as freely as Morita causes some internal problems for Takemoto. For example, when Hagu received a bird brooch that was made for her as an anonymous present, Takemoto couldn\'t bring himself to say that Morita was the one who had made it for her. Instead of acting on his feelings, Takemoto decides to be more of a brother figure to Hagu, giving her friendly support when needed. For example, Takemoto accepts Hagu\'s requests to build her sophisticated dollhouses and the like. Takemoto is very close to her.  His relationship with his family also contributes to his mellow mood. His father died when he was still young. Also, his mother works at a hospital as a nurse, so Takemoto would usually spend a lot of his time there, even his Christmas holidays. Furthermore, Takemoto is uncomfortable with his mother\'s new husband, an outspoken man whose persona seems to a polar opposite to that of his father. However, Takemoto tries to get used to his company and tries to accept the fact that his step-father is capable of looking after his mother, since Takemoto has worried about his mother\'s well-being ever since he left home. His mother\'s remarriage and her assurance that he is now free to do as he wishes instead of taking care of her all the time later influenced Takemoto\'s decision to attend art college.

After arriving back to Tokyo, he finally confesses his feelings for Hagu, but she did not have the courage to answer him, thus Takemoto figured his feelings for her were unrequited.  !~', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}]}}"

Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. \n\nThough he evasively says that he has ""many hobbies"" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of ""Icha Icha Paradise"" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally ""Make Out Paradise""), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, ""Icha Icha Violence"" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally ""Make Out Violence""). In Part II Naruto gives him the new ""Icha Icha Tactics"" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally ""Make Out Tactics"").  \n\nKakashi\'s Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent\'s movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi\'s use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison.

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who\'s listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon ""Clima Tact."" \n\n Usopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Also, Usopp has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father Yassop of the Red Haired Pirate Crew.', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Luffy'}, 'description': '__Height:__ 172 cm (Pre-Timeskip), 174 cm (Post-Timeskip)\n__Devil Fruit:__ Gomu Gomu no Mi (Rubber-Rubber Fruit) \n__Devil Fruit Type:__ Paramecia\n~!__True Devil Fruit:__ Hito Hito no Mi Model: Nika (Human-Human Fruit)\n__True Devil Fruit Type:__ Mythical Zoan!~\n__Bounty:__ ~!3,000,000,000 (previously: 1,500,000,000, 500,000,000, 400,000,000, 300,000,000, 100,000,000 and 30,000,000)!~\n\nLuffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  \n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy\'s case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial ""D"".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D\'s. His only display of true fear towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  \n\nLuffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Author Eiichiro Oda explains that it\'s not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  \n\nLuffy\'s dream is to find the One Piece and become King of the Pirates. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand, and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his normally, tied on the arm bandana, on his head.   \n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but unlike Robin he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.  Zoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he\'s a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master\'s code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics.

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. ~!Except a single fight where he uses knives against a fellow chef.!~ Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef ""Red Leg"" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. ~!He\'s also the third son of the Vinsmoke family.!~ Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his ""love-cook"" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname ""ero-cook"", or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around woman, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can\'t attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a ""strict upbringing"". To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.  Being the crew\'s chef, he looks out for the health of his crew mates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others\' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He\'s also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well.

He also still has distrust in humankind because of events his youth, where he was treated as a brutal monster. He will often outright insult a human who compliments him while smiling, dancing, and being obviously pleased. He also shows a certain interest in books, but mostly medicine related ones.  Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model. This, combined with his naiveness, often causes him to imitate the other Straw Hats\' actions, no matter how obviously silly. Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun. Chopper is one of the most innocent Straw Hat Pirates, and is also very naive, resulting in a tendency to believe anything told to him, even the outrageously fictitious and exaggerated lies of Usopp. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper and continues to refer to him as ""the emergency food supply"" to tease him but considers him a friend.

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency) since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit\'s power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. Robin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.  Robin is actually an archaeologist of talent and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.  Robin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat\'s Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool.

He also has a signature pose which he uses very often.  Franky is quick to defend other people (eg. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a \'big brother\' figure. Monkey D.

After having Ichise save Goto from the Shapes and guiding a losing battle against some shapes with the Alliance, he heads off to the gate to try and talk to the Class. He is let in by the Mothers who then tell him who Kanno is and his plans for taking of Lux and using the Shapes to take over the Class. They tell him that he has to warn the upper world about Kanno&#039;s plans.    Instead, he returns to Lux and asks Doc to tell the upper world because he believes they will be more receptive to her. He asks Ichise to go with her, but tells him that his debt is repaid.    Along with Shinji, he gathers the men of Lux up in order to oppose the Shape forces. Under his leadership, they&#039;re able to ultimately win a very bloody battle with their enemies, though at the cost of many, many lives.

When he was younger, his father, Ikuse, was killed for what Ichise believes was betraying his friends. A short time after, his mother also died. All he was left with was a vial that contained some of his mother's cells. Soon after, he began his life as a fighter in an underground arena, and proved to be quite formidable.  Ichise is very quiet and rarely speaks. He has an odd tendency to go berserk at very inopportune times. Whenever something has angered him, he channels nearly all his energy in an effort to destroy whatever it is that has crossed him. Throughout the course the series, he becomes a little more open, but still remains fairly reserved unless someone directly asks him a question.   ~!After one of his fights, he gets into some trouble with Aida, the man who runs the arena. He was rewarded with some cheap sex, but becomes slightly hostile during the love-making. Aida calls up Isshii, a member of Organ, to come and punish Ichise. He does so by lopping off Ichise's right arm. Afterwards, Ichise goes berserk and ends up getting his left leg cut off in similar fashion by Isshii.  He manages to get around with a crude crutch, but ends up giving up in despair after he continually has trouble with stairs. Oonishi, the leader of Organ, calls up Doc and tells her that Ichise might be a decent guinea pig for her research. With Doc's 'help', he gets a new Texhnolyzed arm and leg.  At first, he abhors his new limbs, but manages. He sees Isshii again and attempts to attack him, but is put down by Isshii's men. He is thrown into the sewers, but manages to escape with the help of Ran. He then spends some time practicing with his Texhnolyze to get the hang of it. He locates Isshii later and manages to beat the shit out of him.  He then walks around with Ran for awhile. He runs into Shinji, leader of Lakan, who invites him to Lakan's headquarters. There, he practices the sensitivity of his Texhnolyze. He then leaves and shows up again in the middle of a large confrontation between Organ, the Alliance, and Lakan, where he inadvertantly sets off the spark that starts the war. At the end of the battle, Oonishi brings him along where he eventually stops Yoshii from destroying Lux.  Oonishi then includes him as a temporary member of Organ and assigns him to work under Kohagura. He works alongside Touyama and captures Sakizaki, who stops Mizuno's half-assed plans of taking over Lux. He also discovers the people who framed his father and beats the shit out of them.  After that, he becomes an official member of Organ. He helps uncover Gabe's factory that is mass-producing weapons and saves Oonishi's life when Mizuno tries to kill him. At that point, Ran tells him his future wherein he will destroy everyone and will end up all alone in the end. After getting some nice upgrades to his Texhnolyze courtesy of Doc, he helps Kohagura and Sonada escape from Tsujinaka's men, then kills Tsujinaka under Kohagura's orders. Afterwards, he is assigned to protect Goto when the Shapes make their appearance. He saves Goto from being killed and helps Organ fight back against the Shapes.  Oonishi then asks him to go and find Doc to help the wounded. After finally getting her to agree to come out, she tries to pull some lovey-dovey stuff on him and says that they should just go to Gabe and spend their lives together because the people of Lux are doomed. They then see Ran in the center of Lux and run into Oonishi and Shinji at the train station. Oonishi asks him to go with Doc to warn the people of Kanno's plan, but he refuses because he's worried about Ran. Oonishi tells him that his debt has been repaid so he is free to decide for himself what he will do.  He heads to the upper world with Doc. Upon getting there, he realizes that the Class is no different than Lux - everyone is just sitting around and waiting for death. He realizes the trip was pointless and heads back to Lux. Before he can get there, he runs into Touyama and is forced in a katana duel, which he wins. He also meets with his deceased father and apologizes for how badly he had thought of him through the years when his hatred should have been placed on the thugs that framed him.  He eventually makes it back to Lux only to find out that no Texhnolyze works anymore. He meets Goto who tells him that it's pointless to head back into the city. He goes there, anyway. He meets with Ran and tells her that he wants to bring her to the upper world where there is no fighting. He tells her that he believes he is her guardian angel and that's why he came back.  He watches as Oonishi is annihilated by the men of Lux, at which point he goes berserker and beats the hell out of them all as he regains partial control of his Texhnolyze with Doc's help. He heads for the Opera House to find Kanno and, consequently, Ran. When he asks about Ran, he gets a long-winded story about Kanno's motives.  He eventually finds out that Ran has been Shaped and that her 'spirit' has been killed and she basically has no more consciousness. He is mighty miffed that Kanno did this and, despite knowing that Kanno is the life-blood of the Lux, lops his head of with a powerful fist to the face.  He returns what's left of Ran to the place where the Elder's body was finally laid to rest and finds exile in a building on the outskirts of the city. He glances over the city one last time, then rolls over to his side and watches his Texhnolyze arm play a crude, line-art of Ran's flower.

But despite his strength, he adheres to a principle of pacifism and often refuses to outright kill his opponents, also he has sworn to never kill a human again and adheres to that promise regardless of how hard it gets for him to do so. Abel is shown in flashbacks to have a hatred for humanity, but at some point that changes into his current pacifistic and peaceful outlook on life. He acknowledges having greatly sinned at some point in his life, though it is unclear as to what sin he committed, and much of his current personality is based on retribution for his sins. Abel has at one point referred to his Crusnik form as &quot;a mark of his sins&quot;, though it is unknown what he meant by that. He has feelings towards Esther Blanchett, though they are more related to her similarities with a woman from his past. In his human form he fights with a gun that shoots silver bullets. As a Crusnik, is able to transform into various forms based on the amount of nanomachines in his body that he activates. In his higher forms he wields a huge scythe materialized from his own blood. In The Star Of Sorrow II, it is revealed that pre-Armageddon, Nightroad was Commander in the UN Air and Space Force involved in the &quot;Red Mars&quot; project. [...]    The following information may contain spoilers for those who wish to read the manga/novel:   ~!On the surface, Abel appears to be a clumsy, absent-minded Catholic priest who has bad luck with money and is always hungry. In reality, he is a Crusnik, a vampire with extraordinary powers that feed especially on other vampires. Nearly a millennium in age, Abel was created in 2088 A.D. as one of four test tube babies whose bodies were infused with Crusnik nanomachines by the Mars human colonists. Abel once had a hatred for humanity and joined the Methuselah in the war against humans after the Armageddon. During the war between the humans and Methuselah, Abel Nightroad killed seven million humans. Lilith&#039;s death during the war caused him to abandon his hatred. He spent 900 years weeping and mourning in Lilith&#039;s crypt at the Vatican, until a young Caterina Sforza fled there to escape Methuselah assassins. Abel, realizing that it was his task to continue Lilith&#039;s work and defend the humans, saved the young Caterina and chose to live on. He joined the AX at its foundation in May, 3055 A.D.    In penance for his earlier sins, Abel now adheres to a strict principle of pacifism and has taken a vow not to kill unless he absolutely must. Though accepting of his Crusnik form, he will generally only use it as a last resort. After meeting Esther, he is reluctant to use his Crusnik form in a battle for fear of her seeing it, and after she does see it for the first time, Abel is extremely distraught and screams in agony. Later he tells her it is the mark of his sins. Notably, in regards to Esther, in the novels and manga, Abel first reveals his Crusnik form during the Star of Sorrow arc, not long after he meets her, and, in the manga, part of her reasons for joining AX is to find out more about Abel (also in the novels, he is nowhere near as distraught for showing her as in the anime). He seems to be oblivious to Esther&#039;s romantic feelings for him, and possibly to his own feelings for her. Asthe seems to have noticed, though, and calls him a dunce for not being bothered by Ion&#039;s affections for Esther. While he mostly responds to her with fatherly affection, when he thought she had been killed, he lost control of himself and went into Crusnik form, seeming to delight in killing the Methuselah Radu who he thought had killed Esther. It is Esther that helps him return to normal.    Abel eventually learns that Lilith&#039;s killer and his brother, Cain, is still alive and swears to find and kill him, once and for all. After Abel finds and confronts him, Cain defeats Abel and sends him into a near death state. While Esther mourns at Abel&#039;s grave, Cardinal Caterina retrieves the nanomachines from Lilith&#039;s body and sends Father Tres to take them to Abel in order to revive him. Tres delivers them to Abel&#039;s grave, both reviving him and allowing him to achieve 100% Crusnik fusion without the insanity that manifested in Cain. Immediately afterwards, Cain arrives and Abel battles him again, but the fight ends in a draw and Abel must continue his quest to destroy his brother, now joined by Ion Fortuna    In his human form, Abel fights with a gun loaded with silver bullets. With 40% of his Crusnik nanomachines activated, his eyes become red, his lips turn dark blue, his teeth become fangs, and a gigantic red scythe composed of crystallized blood materializes in his hands. At 80% activation, his nails turn into claws, grows black wings and he can generate massive amounts of electricity. He can only achieve this form, or higher, if he has fed on a vampire, otherwise there is a risk the nanomachines will refuse the command and cause him to collapse. At 100% activation, he turns into a humanoid creature with dark skin, black bat-like wings, and blue markings that cover his entire body. He also generates more electricity than his 80% form and a second blade forms on the other end of his blood scythe. While in Crusnik form, the blood of Methuselah is drawn to him and goes directly into his body without using his fangs.!~  (Source: Wikipedia)', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}]}}"

He left in the middle of his training and without his master\'s blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono.

It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again.\n\nKenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally. He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.). He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end).

She is shown to be slightly more eager, probably from a sense of duty, to participate in the Alice Game than her sisters. In the OVA, she is introduced in the flashback in mid-fight with Shinku and later does not hold back in attacking a then-harmless Suigintou. Throughout Rozen Maiden träumend, she questions her idyllic lifestyle, and much to Suiseiseki\'s disappointment, takes part in the Alice Game out of devotion to Rozen, to fulfill his wish of finding Alice and relieve his perceived grief.    ~!She battles Suigintou, but is defeated and loses her Rosa Mystica.!~  ~!Even though the two versions progress differently, Souseiseki is still the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, and to Suigintou in both instances. However, at the end of Rozen Maiden träumend, Laplace is seen dancing with two Rosae Mysticae, one of which is believed to be Souseiseki\'s. To add to the confusion, after Shinku is resurrected by ""Father,"" she tells Jun that Souseiseki\'s and Hinaichigo\'s losing their Rosa Mystica\'s is her burden to bear. The most likely reson for this is that essentially they were under the care of her medium, which makes sense for Hinaichigo but only to an extent with Souseiseki. Though she is the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, Souseiseki is actually the second doll to lose in the Alice Game.!~  ~!Recently in the manga, Souseiseki\'s body was missing from her case. It was found out that Kirakishou used Souseiseki\'s body to be able to set foot on the human world. Kirakishou tried to stop Shinku, Suigintou and Suiseiseki from retrieving back Souseiseki\'s body by forcing older Jun to be her medium and permanently having that body. Though Jun accidentally made a contract on Suiseiseki\'s ring, which was sooner found out that it was Souseiseki\'s ring, Kirakishou started leaving her body. The only step needed to bring Souseiseki back is to get her rosa mystica from Suigintou.   Due to Suigintou\'s stuborness, she didn\'t give it back resulting Suiseiseki putting her own rosa mystica in her twin. They soon meet Souseiseki, revieved, with Suiseiseki, lifeless. Suigintou was telling Shinku that the Souseiseki they are seeing is a trap of the 7th doll, which the truth is not. According to Souseiseki, Rozen used to say that among seven rosa mysticas, the only two allocated to Suiseiseki and Souseiseki were different from others, by chance they were mutually paired in the begining and they were also called twin stones. Therefore, Suiseiseki took a chance on putting her rosa mystica into Souseiseki\'s body as substitution with knowledge of a risk of failure.  Suigintou described that Souseiseki\'s approach as unbeautiful. Souseiseki not just agreed with her but also thought that she needs to get the rosa mystica back to where it should be. Still, she intended not to do that then and there but to prioritized escaping from Kirakishou\'s field with Shinku and Suigintou.  Soon they all meet with older Jun and Kanaria, with Souseiseki introducing herself to her medium (since he made a contract with her). The group then saw a big imitation clock. Shinku and the others were discussing how to restart it. Souseiseki noticed the clock had been made of wood at that time and then she said she may well be able to make it re-activated if she gains the cooperation of Suiseiseki because they are capable of controlling plant lives.   To restart the clock, Souseiseki needed to resurrect Suiseiseki. And thus, Souseiseki tried borrowing her Rosa Mystica from Suigintou only during rebooting the clock by a deal that Souseiseki will really accept Suigintou as a winner and remove the pain lingering on Suigintou\'s body instead of borrowing the Rosa Mystica.  Suigintou first looked apparently unreluctant, she eventually seemed to approve the deal. In this way, Suiseiseki came back to life. Souseiseki, however, determined to tell Suiseiseki a lie for the first and last time before resurrecting her. So, about how Suiseiseki could be back in, Souseiseki just explained it to her as follows; ""Suigintou returned the Rosa Mystica."" And then Suiseiseki ironically spoke to Suigintou, ""I think better of you than I did before.""  Suiseiseki also asked Souseiseki, ""Can we be together for eternity after returning to the original world?"" and Souseiseki replied to her ""Yes."" This is her first and last lie because Souseiseki promised to give her Rosa Mystica back to Suigintou after restarting the clock. !~  ~!After restarting the wooden clock, two branches were reveled. as this is the connection of the wound world and the not wound world. Then they saw how Shinku collapsed and broke into pieces for time has run out. While the older Jun was crying over what is happening to Shinku, Suigintou immediately demanded Souseiseki to do the deal. Suiseiseki was confused and was about to go after Suigintou but Souseiseki stops her and tells her the deal. Suigintou stopped Suiseiseki from interfering while Souseiseki was about to give her rosa mystica to Suigintou. But just in time, younger Jun and Kanaria returned to them with Shinku\'s real body. They explain what happened to the body and how Hina Ichigo\'s rosa mystica guarded the body. Suigintou was surprised in what Hina Ichigo did in spite that their destiny is the Alice Game. Suigintou told Souseiseki not to continue with the deal because this made her think. Though she told Souseiseki not to be mistaken because Souseiseki\'s body is just for storage, and her rosa mystica is still Suigintou\'s property. Suigintou flew away while Suiseiseki was relieved and overjoyed being with her twin sister again.

She can be relied on for the occasional bit of parent-like wisdom. Despite her aristocratic quirks, Shinku is the most level-headed doll living in Jun\'s house.  However, her one weakness is her fear of imperfection; a fear that is powerful enough to shatter her normally cool demeanor.  Father put so much effort into her that she feels an obsessive need to become Alice.  In her eyes, the Alice Game is cruel, and she is reluctant to take the souls of her sisters, leaving them as the lifeless ""junk"" they fear more than anything else.

Despite her relative youth amongst the Rozen Maidens, the other dolls look up to her as an older sister, and a worthy challenger in the Alice Game. Shinku does have a cute side, which is evident in her intense, almost obsessive, admiration for the puppet detective Kun Kun. Jun was once able to win her over during an argument by using a Kun Kun doll. Shinku hates cats because one almost ate her wind-up key in the past.  Along with being the central doll in the series, Shinku seems to hold a special place in ""Father""\'s heart; he had given her a special brooch with his image when she was created, which Suigintou destroyed out of jealousy. Shinku desires to become ""Alice,"" but she refuses to use deadly force against her sisters and believes that there must be a way to become Alice without taking part in the Alice Game as told to her by ""Father"".  In combat, Shinku fights with rose petal-based attacks, making her one of the strongest dolls in battle. The rose petals are extremely versatile; Shinku can direct them to spread out for wide-ranging attacks, or group them together to use as a shield.

She eventually realizes that it is her master\'s heart that needs to be freed and sacrifices herself to do.    ~!The dolls present are shocked by Souseiseki\'s actions and Suigintou uses the confusion to snatch Souseiseki\'s Rosa Mystica.!~ In the anime, Souseiseki is devoted to a lonesome old man, who uses her as a substitute for his deceased son, Kazuki. She is shown to be slightly more eager, probably from a sense of duty, to participate in the Alice Game than her sisters. In the OVA, she is introduced in the flashback in mid-fight with Shinku and later does not hold back in attacking a then-harmless Suigintou. Throughout Rozen Maiden träumend, she questions her idyllic lifestyle, and much to Suiseiseki\'s disappointment, takes part in the Alice Game out of devotion to Rozen, to fulfill his wish of finding Alice and relieve his perceived grief.    ~!She battles Suigintou, but is defeated and loses her Rosa Mystica.!~  ~!Even though the two versions progress differently, Souseiseki is still the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, and to Suigintou in both instances. However, at the end of Rozen Maiden träumend, Laplace is seen dancing with two Rosae Mysticae, one of which is believed to be Souseiseki\'s. To add to the confusion, after Shinku is resurrected by ""Father,"" she tells Jun that Souseiseki\'s and Hinaichigo\'s losing their Rosa Mystica\'s is her burden to bear. The most likely reson for this is that essentially they were under the care of her medium, which makes sense for Hinaichigo but only to an extent with Souseiseki. Though she is the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, Souseiseki is actually the second doll to lose in the Alice Game.!~  ~!Recently in the manga, Souseiseki\'s body was missing from her case. It was found out that Kirakishou used Souseiseki\'s body to be able to set foot on the human world. Kirakishou tried to stop Shinku, Suigintou and Suiseiseki from retrieving back Souseiseki\'s body by forcing older Jun to be her medium and permanently having that body. Though Jun accidentally made a contract on Suiseiseki\'s ring, which was sooner found out that it was Souseiseki\'s ring, Kirakishou started leaving her body. The only step needed to bring Souseiseki back is to get her rosa mystica from Suigintou.   Due to Suigintou\'s stuborness, she didn\'t give it back resulting Suiseiseki putting her own rosa mystica in her twin. They soon meet Souseiseki, revieved, with Suiseiseki, lifeless. Suigintou was telling Shinku that the Souseiseki they are seeing is a trap of the 7th doll, which the truth is not. According to Souseiseki, Rozen used to say that among seven rosa mysticas, the only two allocated to Suiseiseki and Souseiseki were different from others, by chance they were mutually paired in the begining and they were also called twin stones. Therefore, Suiseiseki took a chance on putting her rosa mystica into Souseiseki\'s body as substitution with knowledge of a risk of failure.  Suigintou described that Souseiseki\'s approach as unbeautiful. Souseiseki not just agreed with her but also thought that she needs to get the rosa mystica back to where it should be. Still, she intended not to do that then and there but to prioritized escaping from Kirakishou\'s field with Shinku and Suigintou.  Soon they all meet with older Jun and Kanaria, with Souseiseki introducing herself to her medium (since he made a contract with her). The group then saw a big imitation clock. Shinku and the others were discussing how to restart it. Souseiseki noticed the clock had been made of wood at that time and then she said she may well be able to make it re-activated if she gains the cooperation of Suiseiseki because they are capable of controlling plant lives.   To restart the clock, Souseiseki needed to resurrect Suiseiseki. And thus, Souseiseki tried borrowing her Rosa Mystica from Suigintou only during rebooting the clock by a deal that Souseiseki will really accept Suigintou as a winner and remove the pain lingering on Suigintou\'s body instead of borrowing the Rosa Mystica.  Suigintou first looked apparently unreluctant, she eventually seemed to approve the deal. In this way, Suiseiseki came back to life. Souseiseki, however, determined to tell Suiseiseki a lie for the first and last time before resurrecting her. So, about how Suiseiseki could be back in, Souseiseki just explained it to her as follows; ""Suigintou returned the Rosa Mystica."" And then Suiseiseki ironically spoke to Suigintou, ""I think better of you than I did before.""  Suiseiseki also asked Souseiseki, ""Can we be together for eternity after returning to the original world?"" and Souseiseki replied to her ""Yes."" This is her first and last lie because Souseiseki promised to give her Rosa Mystica back to Suigintou after restarting the clock. !~  ~!After restarting the wooden clock, two branches were reveled. as this is the connection of the wound world and the not wound world. Then they saw how Shinku collapsed and broke into pieces for time has run out. While the older Jun was crying over what is happening to Shinku, Suigintou immediately demanded Souseiseki to do the deal. Suiseiseki was confused and was about to go after Suigintou but Souseiseki stops her and tells her the deal. Suigintou stopped Suiseiseki from interfering while Souseiseki was about to give her rosa mystica to Suigintou. But just in time, younger Jun and Kanaria returned to them with Shinku\'s real body. They explain what happened to the body and how Hina Ichigo\'s rosa mystica guarded the body. Suigintou was surprised in what Hina Ichigo did in spite that their destiny is the Alice Game. Suigintou told Souseiseki not to continue with the deal because this made her think. Though she told Souseiseki not to be mistaken because Souseiseki\'s body is just for storage, and her rosa mystica is still Suigintou\'s property. Suigintou flew away while Suiseiseki was relieved and overjoyed being with her twin sister again. Older Jun told Souseiseki that her ring will go to the younger Jun in their world since both of them are still the same person.!~ Her artificial spirit is named for a fragrance by Lolita Lempicka.

She can be relied on for the occasional bit of parent-like wisdom. Despite her aristocratic quirks, Shinku is the most level-headed doll living in Jun\'s house.  However, her one weakness is her fear of imperfection; a fear that is powerful enough to shatter her normally cool demeanor.  Father put so much effort into her that she feels an obsessive need to become Alice.  In her eyes, the Alice Game is cruel, and she is reluctant to take the souls of her sisters, leaving them as the lifeless ""junk"" they fear more than anything else.

Despite her relative youth amongst the Rozen Maidens, the other dolls look up to her as an older sister, and a worthy challenger in the Alice Game. Shinku does have a cute side, which is evident in her intense, almost obsessive, admiration for the puppet detective Kun Kun. Jun was once able to win her over during an argument by using a Kun Kun doll. Shinku hates cats because one almost ate her wind-up key in the past.  Along with being the central doll in the series, Shinku seems to hold a special place in ""Father""\'s heart; he had given her a special brooch with his image when she was created, which Suigintou destroyed out of jealousy. Shinku desires to become ""Alice,"" but she refuses to use deadly force against her sisters and believes that there must be a way to become Alice without taking part in the Alice Game as told to her by ""Father"".  In combat, Shinku fights with rose petal-based attacks, making her one of the strongest dolls in battle. The rose petals are extremely versatile; Shinku can direct them to spread out for wide-ranging attacks, or group them together to use as a shield. Her other weapon is a cane, which she skillfully wields like a sword. Shinku has other special powers, such as restoring broken objects, typically Jun\'s bedroom windows after Suiseiseki and Souseiseki show up, with a form of time-reversing magic.

She is beaten by Shinku in the Alice Game, becoming the first doll to lose the ability to become Alice. Shinku does not beat Hinaichigo outright; the younger doll simply exhausted the energy of her medium, Tomoe. Shinku then warned Hinaichigo that continuing the fight would kill Tomoe, whereupon Hinaichigo renounced the tie that made Tomoe her medium.

She is kind of a ""creampuff-maniac"" since her personality drastically changes when the topic is about creampuffs (as seen in the anime and in manga chapter 206).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia) ', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Gen'}, 'description': '__Position:__ Kicker/Linebacker  \n__Jersey:__ 11  \n__40 yard dash:__ 5.6 seconds  \n__Bench Press:__ 90 kgs  \n__Height:__ 177 cm (5\' 9"")  \n\nThe place kicker for the Devil Bats and one of the original three members of the team (along with Hiruma and Kurita). He is often mistaken for an older person (even though he is only 17), since he initially has a bit of stubble and has a buzz-cut. He leaves the team during the spring season of his freshman year, due to the fact that his father had become seriously ill. As a result, he was forced to drop out of school and take over as the construction foreman of Deimon High. Though he desperately wants to get back into playing, he refused to rejoin the Devil Bats. However, after meeting with Sena and Monta and seeing how determined they are to get him back on the team, he agrees, but only if they become a strong team. In the manga, Musashi makes his comeback during the game against Seibu, when his father hit him for abandoning his team. In the anime, however, he does not rejoin the team until the game with the Bando Spiders. He has a running rivalry with the kicker of the Spiders Sasaki Koutaro who, according to Hiruma, has never missed. Musashi has an incredibly strong right leg which helps the Devil Bats on kickoffs, often pinning their opponents deep or forcing them to down the ball deep in their own territory, or in their end zone for a touchback. The title of the 60-yard Magnum was actually a lie fabricated by Hiruma, in order to make Musashi seem invincible, and Musashi keeps telling people that it is a lie. The kanji in Musashi\'s last name, Takekura, can also be read as Musashi, thus his nickname. The name is derived from Miyamoto Musashi, a famous samurai, who was famous for his skills with two swords, which relates to the fact that Musashi must put up two kicks for every successful possession (extra point kick or field goal and the kick off). Gen\'s rivalry with the Bando Spiders kicker Sasaki Koutaro is also a play on Miyamoto\'s rivalry with the legendary swordsman Sasaki Kojiro.

He resembles an ape, particularly a chimpanzee, in many ways; indeed, his simian similarity is the character\'s running joke throughout the manga. Although he is as short as Sena, his large hands, arms (that are noticeably longer than his legs), acrobatic moves, and leaping ability make him a very effective receiver; he can even catch Hiruma\'s bullet passes with one hand. He has a habit of posing every time he makes a spectacular catch for a touchdown, rolling after the jump, and breaking out of the roll by kneeling and pointing upwards with his index finger. He also has the habit of attaching \'Max\' to nearly everything he does (suffixing his phrases with MAX! in the Japanese, and prefixing them with MAXI-! in the English), since he believes that one should give 100% effort in all endeavors.   He was named Monta after Sena mistook his name as Rai Montarou. He begins to like being called \'Monta\' after Hiruma tells him the nickname \'Monta\' was supposedly derived from Joe Montana. Monta does not know that Joe Montana is a quarterback, not a wide receiver. Monta has a crush on Mamori. He\'s always trying to win her heart, often failing miserably, because she always gives more attention to Sena. Monta\'s throwing is incredibly horrible: he moves his arm in the right direction, but somehow, the ball goes in a completely different direction! Not only that, but his kicking is similar. His throws/kicks usually hit someone on the head, or break a window. Monta is also known for his bad grammar, as he once said that he will ""restore his disgrace, but was corrected by Hiruma, and Hiruma even requested that someone ""teach that monkey how to communicate with humans "", which embarrassed him even further.   At the same time, although he is considered an idiot, he gives wonderful motivational speeches, especially to Sena.

It is unknown whether Rika fully reciprocates the feelings that Mayama has for her, but various flashbacks imply that Mayama and Rika have \'fooled around\', or Mayama took advantage of Rika\'s disability to fulfill his desires, although this is cleared up later as not being the case. Rika suggested that Mayama find another job so that she wouldn\'t have to continue hurting him, as she realizes how much he cares for her, and is unable (and perhaps unwilling at that point) to allow him to enter into her life.  Mayama eventually landed a job at Fujiwara Design. He has to deal with coworkers that are also very interested in his love life, and make comments whenever they can.

Morita is unable to graduate, as he can never wake up on time to go to classes. This is mainly due to the work that he does, which forces him to go missing for periods of time. What he does for work though remains a mystery. When Morita comes back from his mysterious job, he immediately falls asleep for at least 48 hours, due to the amount of work he does. He also returns with a large sum of money in his back-pocket and brings a food item to share with his flat mates. Although the flat mates believe he does it to mock them, such as when he brings a bag of croquettes instead of meat, Morita does care deeply for his friends such as Takemoto.  Morita is a very mysterious person. He does many random, crazy things for his personal enjoyment, such as creating a twister game with too many colors, which resulted in horrific pain for him and Takemoto. Morita is a perceptive individual, but tactless and often states the truth, such as how Mayama secretly stalks Rika outside her apartment, when nobody wants to hear it. He also expresses his love for Hagu in weird and quirky ways, such as forcing Hagu to dress up as a mouse. Morita\'s obsession with Hagu stems from a fondness of cute things during his childhood, such as causing a cat to become neurotic after cuddling it too much.    \n\n~!As a result of Morita\'s obsession Hagu becomes afraid of him and tries to avoid him but eventually falls in love with him later on.

She is 18 years of age at the beginning of the series and her appearance is that of a child, and she conveniently behaves as one. Raised in a largely sheltered and obscure home by her irritable grandmother, her sociability is below average. It is whilst living in that home that Hagu develops her skill in drawing and painting, her only past-time, though she finds nothing to sketch save for the never-changing view she has from her porch, varying only in seasons. Hagu is from Azumino city, Nagano-ken.   ~! She is introduced to Takemoto, Morita and Mayama by Shūji, her mother\'s cousin and also a professor at the college. Upon seeing her, Morita and Takemoto fall in love with her, though both express it in different ways. Hagu knows not of their feelings towards her, but sees them as friends. However, Morita expresses his love for her in very odd ways, and Hagu is often seen trying to escape from whatever shenanigan Morita has planned for her. Though later Hagu develops feelings towards Morita, although she does not at first realize this, as Shūji points out.  Hagu is very shy, and because she is so nervous when interacting with people, the other art students think that she is strange. Hagu doesn\'t seem to be too close with family members either, with the exception of Shūji, whom she fondly calls ""Shū-chan"". However, as the series progresses, Hagu is able to become closer friends with Takemoto, Mayama, Morita and Yamada. When Shūji leaves to go do a research project in Mongolia, Hagu forms a deeper bond with each of them, essentially seeing them as a sort of family. Hagu lives with Yamada (whom she calls ""Ayu"") when Shūji is away and they become very close friends.

Mayama tries very hard to comfort her but failing rather miserably saying that ""You\'ll have one of those when you\'re older....probably"". While Hagu is crying, Morita is also crying because of her infectious tears.  Later in the series, Hagu started to avoid Takemoto after he confessed his feelings for her, leaving doubts if his love for her is reciprocated or not.

Takemoto studies architecture, but has little certainty as to what he wishes to do upon graduating; his decision to attend art college was because he liked to build things with his hands, like he had with his father.  Takemoto is one of the more mellow characters in the series. He falls in love with Hagu immediately after being introduced by his professor and keeps his feelings to himself throughout most of the series. His love for Hagu and his inability to act upon his feelings as freely as Morita causes some internal problems for Takemoto. For example, when Hagu received a bird brooch that was made for her as an anonymous present, Takemoto couldn\'t bring himself to say that Morita was the one who had made it for her. Instead of acting on his feelings, Takemoto decides to be more of a brother figure to Hagu, giving her friendly support when needed. For example, Takemoto accepts Hagu\'s requests to build her sophisticated dollhouses and the like. Takemoto is very close to her.  His relationship with his family also contributes to his mellow mood. His father died when he was still young. Also, his mother works at a hospital as a nurse, so Takemoto would usually spend a lot of his time there, even his Christmas holidays. Furthermore, Takemoto is uncomfortable with his mother\'s new husband, an outspoken man whose persona seems to a polar opposite to that of his father. However, Takemoto tries to get used to his company and tries to accept the fact that his step-father is capable of looking after his mother, since Takemoto has worried about his mother\'s well-being ever since he left home. His mother\'s remarriage and her assurance that he is now free to do as he wishes instead of taking care of her all the time later influenced Takemoto\'s decision to attend art college.

After his fight with Naruto he believes he's been wasting his time 'playing ninja' with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can revenge his clan by killing Itachi and then to restore the Uchiha clan.

Due to his past, Kakashi became someone who followed strictly by-the-book, even to the detriment of teamwork.!~\n\n~!After Obito\'s death he adopted many of Obito\'s traits. One such trait was Obito\'s concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way Kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. Kakashi also inherits Obito\'s chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to Konoha\'s memorial site, where Obito\'s name is engraved. Ironically, this very habit is one that Kakashi was often annoyed at Obito about. Kakashi\'s personal life appears to be as much of a mystery as the face behind the mask he has worn for most of his ninja career. He has no living family, or at least none he cares to acknowledge, and he\'s confirmed that everyone he loves is already dead.!~  \n\nKakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi\'s subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. \n\nThough he evasively says that he has ""many hobbies"" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of ""Icha Icha Paradise"" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally ""Make Out Paradise""), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, ""Icha Icha Violence"" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally ""Make Out Violence""). In Part II Naruto gives him the new ""Icha Icha Tactics"" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally ""Make Out Tactics"").  \n\nKakashi\'s Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent\'s movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles.

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who\'s listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon ""Clima Tact."" \n\n Usopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions.

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  \n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy\'s case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial ""D"".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D\'s. His only display of true fear towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  \n\nLuffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Author Eiichiro Oda explains that it\'s not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  \n\nLuffy\'s dream is to find the One Piece and become King of the Pirates.

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand, and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his normally, tied on the arm bandana, on his head.   \n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but unlike Robin he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.  Zoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he\'s a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master\'s code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics.

He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. ~!He\'s also the third son of the Vinsmoke family.!~ Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his ""love-cook"" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname ""ero-cook"", or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around woman, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can\'t attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a ""strict upbringing"". To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.  Being the crew\'s chef, he looks out for the health of his crew mates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others\' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He\'s also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well.

Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model.

Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun.

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency) since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit\'s power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. Robin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock.

The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.

Most of the main council of Organ had some kind of qualm with Oonishi, first and foremost being his passive nature. Even on the battlefield, he prefers to not kill his opponents.

He gets his wishes and has Oonishi on the run after the large skirmish between Organ, the Alliance, and Lakan. Soon after, his wife is taken hostage by Yoshii and is killed in a skirmish.

Ichise is very quiet and rarely speaks. He has an odd tendency to go berserk at very inopportune times. Whenever something has angered him, he channels nearly all his energy in an effort to destroy whatever it is that has crossed him. Throughout the course the series, he becomes a little more open, but still remains fairly reserved unless someone directly asks him a question.   ~!After one of his fights, he gets into some trouble with Aida, the man who runs the arena. He was rewarded with some cheap sex, but becomes slightly hostile during the love-making. Aida calls up Isshii, a member of Organ, to come and punish Ichise. He does so by lopping off Ichise's right arm. Afterwards, Ichise goes berserk and ends up getting his left leg cut off in similar fashion by Isshii.  He manages to get around with a crude crutch, but ends up giving up in despair after he continually has trouble with stairs. Oonishi, the leader of Organ, calls up Doc and tells her that Ichise might be a decent guinea pig for her research. With Doc's 'help', he gets a new Texhnolyzed arm and leg.  At first, he abhors his new limbs, but manages. He sees Isshii again and attempts to attack him, but is put down by Isshii's men.

He locates Isshii later and manages to beat the shit out of him.  He then walks around with Ran for awhile. He runs into Shinji, leader of Lakan, who invites him to Lakan's headquarters. There, he practices the sensitivity of his Texhnolyze. He then leaves and shows up again in the middle of a large confrontation between Organ, the Alliance, and Lakan, where he inadvertantly sets off the spark that starts the war. At the end of the battle, Oonishi brings him along where he eventually stops Yoshii from destroying Lux.  Oonishi then includes him as a temporary member of Organ and assigns him to work under Kohagura. He works alongside Touyama and captures Sakizaki, who stops Mizuno's half-assed plans of taking over Lux. He also discovers the people who framed his father and beats the shit out of them.  After that, he becomes an official member of Organ. He helps uncover Gabe's factory that is mass-producing weapons and saves Oonishi's life when Mizuno tries to kill him. At that point, Ran tells him his future wherein he will destroy everyone and will end up all alone in the end. After getting some nice upgrades to his Texhnolyze courtesy of Doc, he helps Kohagura and Sonada escape from Tsujinaka's men, then kills Tsujinaka under Kohagura's orders. Afterwards, he is assigned to protect Goto when the Shapes make their appearance. He saves Goto from being killed and helps Organ fight back against the Shapes.  Oonishi then asks him to go and find Doc to help the wounded. After finally getting her to agree to come out, she tries to pull some lovey-dovey stuff on him and says that they should just go to Gabe and spend their lives together because the people of Lux are doomed. They then see Ran in the center of Lux and run into Oonishi and Shinji at the train station. Oonishi asks him to go with Doc to warn the people of Kanno's plan, but he refuses because he's worried about Ran. Oonishi tells him that his debt has been repaid so he is free to decide for himself what he will do.  He heads to the upper world with Doc.

Before he can get there, he runs into Touyama and is forced in a katana duel, which he wins. He also meets with his deceased father and apologizes for how badly he had thought of him through the years when his hatred should have been placed on the thugs that framed him.  He eventually makes it back to Lux only to find out that no Texhnolyze works anymore. He meets Goto who tells him that it's pointless to head back into the city. He goes there, anyway. He meets with Ran and tells her that he wants to bring her to the upper world where there is no fighting. He tells her that he believes he is her guardian angel and that's why he came back.  He watches as Oonishi is annihilated by the men of Lux, at which point he goes berserker and beats the hell out of them all as he regains partial control of his Texhnolyze with Doc's help.

He eventually finds out that Ran has been Shaped and that her 'spirit' has been killed and she basically has no more consciousness. He is mighty miffed that Kanno did this and, despite knowing that Kanno is the life-blood of the Lux, lops his head of with a powerful fist to the face.  He returns what's left of Ran to the place where the Elder's body was finally laid to rest and finds exile in a building on the outskirts of the city.

[...]    The following information may contain spoilers for those who wish to read the manga/novel:   ~!On the surface, Abel appears to be a clumsy, absent-minded Catholic priest who has bad luck with money and is always hungry. In reality, he is a Crusnik, a vampire with extraordinary powers that feed especially on other vampires. Nearly a millennium in age, Abel was created in 2088 A.D. as one of four test tube babies whose bodies were infused with Crusnik nanomachines by the Mars human colonists. Abel once had a hatred for humanity and joined the Methuselah in the war against humans after the Armageddon. During the war between the humans and Methuselah, Abel Nightroad killed seven million humans. Lilith&#039;s death during the war caused him to abandon his hatred. He spent 900 years weeping and mourning in Lilith&#039;s crypt at the Vatican, until a young Caterina Sforza fled there to escape Methuselah assassins. Abel, realizing that it was his task to continue Lilith&#039;s work and defend the humans, saved the young Caterina and chose to live on. He joined the AX at its foundation in May, 3055 A.D.    In penance for his earlier sins, Abel now adheres to a strict principle of pacifism and has taken a vow not to kill unless he absolutely must. Though accepting of his Crusnik form, he will generally only use it as a last resort. After meeting Esther, he is reluctant to use his Crusnik form in a battle for fear of her seeing it, and after she does see it for the first time, Abel is extremely distraught and screams in agony. Later he tells her it is the mark of his sins. Notably, in regards to Esther, in the novels and manga, Abel first reveals his Crusnik form during the Star of Sorrow arc, not long after he meets her, and, in the manga, part of her reasons for joining AX is to find out more about Abel (also in the novels, he is nowhere near as distraught for showing her as in the anime). He seems to be oblivious to Esther&#039;s romantic feelings for him, and possibly to his own feelings for her. Asthe seems to have noticed, though, and calls him a dunce for not being bothered by Ion&#039;s affections for Esther. While he mostly responds to her with fatherly affection, when he thought she had been killed, he lost control of himself and went into Crusnik form, seeming to delight in killing the Methuselah Radu who he thought had killed Esther. It is Esther that helps him return to normal.    Abel eventually learns that Lilith&#039;s killer and his brother, Cain, is still alive and swears to find and kill him, once and for all. After Abel finds and confronts him, Cain defeats Abel and sends him into a near death state. While Esther mourns at Abel&#039;s grave, Cardinal Caterina retrieves the nanomachines from Lilith&#039;s body and sends Father Tres to take them to Abel in order to revive him. Tres delivers them to Abel&#039;s grave, both reviving him and allowing him to achieve 100% Crusnik fusion without the insanity that manifested in Cain. Immediately afterwards, Cain arrives and Abel battles him again, but the fight ends in a draw and Abel must continue his quest to destroy his brother, now joined by Ion Fortuna    In his human form, Abel fights with a gun loaded with silver bullets. With 40% of his Crusnik nanomachines activated, his eyes become red, his lips turn dark blue, his teeth become fangs, and a gigantic red scythe composed of crystallized blood materializes in his hands. At 80% activation, his nails turn into claws, grows black wings and he can generate massive amounts of electricity. He can only achieve this form, or higher, if he has fed on a vampire, otherwise there is a risk the nanomachines will refuse the command and cause him to collapse. At 100% activation, he turns into a humanoid creature with dark skin, black bat-like wings, and blue markings that cover his entire body. He also generates more electricity than his 80% form and a second blade forms on the other end of his blood scythe. While in Crusnik form, the blood of Methuselah is drawn to him and goes directly into his body without using his fangs.!~  (Source: Wikipedia)', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}]}}"

Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of ""Father"" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou\'s attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than ""Father"". Suigintou\'s desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice.  Suigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Träumend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Träumend finale, she tells Shinku that ""Father"" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.   ~!In the manga, her body is flawed by wings (she is the only Rozen Maiden with them) that have ravaged her back with cracks. Despite these flaws, her love for ""Father"" and willpower is so strong that she can use her powers independently of a medium. Initially, Suigintou\'s will to exist was so strong that she was able to move without actually possessing a Rosa Mystica. Suigintou did not consciously make a contract with Megu, rather, Megu came upon Suigintou as she was reawakening. Suigintou\'s strong sense of independence, as well as disdain towards humanity, kept her avoiding having a medium. She is also the only Rozen Maiden to have been defeated and revived three times.  In Rozen Maiden Ouvertüre, her complete past is revealed. Her intense hatred for Shinku stems from the very moment of Suigintou\'s awakening, when she notices Rozen affixing a brooch with his image on Shinku\'s bow. Nevertheless, they still managed to be friends as Suigintou was ignorant of the Rozen Maidens\' true purpose--destruction of one another through the Alice Game--when they meet in 19th century London. Suigintou stumbles through a mirror in the room of Shinku\'s medium, wailing hysterically for ""Father"". Shinku takes Suigintou in after determining that she is not a threat. Shinku not only teaches her how to walk, but also treats her as an equal. One day, she follows Shinku into an Alice Game battle with Souseiseki, and is cut in half by Souseiseki\'s shears. This reveals her incomplete body, and she vanishes into a watery N-Field where ""Father"" gives her a Rosa Mystica of her own at last, thus, making Suigintou a true Rozen Maiden. Not long after, Shinku admits that she only felt pity for the ""poor, unfinished doll"" that certainly couldn\'t become Alice and insinuates that Suigintou could not possibly be a Rozen Maiden because she is flawed and different from all the others. This angers Suigintou, and she releases her black wings for the first time, beginning an Alice Game battle with Shinku. She eventually pulls Rozen\'s brooch from Shinku\'s ribbon and crushes it in front of her eyes. As Suigintou laughs arrogantly at Shinku\'s anguish, Shinku calls her ""junk"" which acts as the reason she refers to the other dolls as ""junk"" (particularly Shinku) and why she greatly resents being called it herself. The fight between the two becomes even more intense, but Laplace no Ma ends the battle, stating that the Alice Game of that era has ended.!~  Along with her artificial spirit, Meimei, Suigintou\'s weapons are her ragged black wings. With their arrow-like feathers, she can conjure up a shield, a large sword, or even twin black dragons. Suigintou can also create destructive blue flames as a last resort in battle.

She wields these in battle combined with acrobatic flight, her spirit Lempika and her hat which can be thrown and returns like a boomerang, a tactic she used to temporarily disarm Shinku in their second fight. She also has heterochromatic eyes like Suiseiseki, but the colors are the mirror image of her sister\'s. Her personality is also the polar opposite of Suiseiseki; she is rational, calm, quiet and deeply devoted to her master and to her duties, including the Alice Game. She possesses a sharpness in her speech that is similar to Shinku\'s, attacks ruthlessly in combat, and does not tolerate sub-par actions. Her appearance is not only the most masculine of the dolls, but her speech is also noted to be of the masculine form, using the first person pronoun ""boku"" instead of gender neutral pronouns like ""jibun"" or ""watashi."" Souseiseki\'s presence is much more significant in the anime than in the manga.  In the manga, her master wanted to use Souseiseki\'s power to enter other people\'s dreams and exact revenge on his brother\'s lover, who he felt had stolen his brother from him. Since Souseiseki alone could not achieve this goal, she fights Suiseiseki to gather the two gardeners\' tools, the shears of the Gardener and the watering can of the Gardener, which together can affect an individual\'s soul tree. She eventually realizes that it is her master\'s heart that needs to be freed and sacrifices herself to do.    ~!The dolls present are shocked by Souseiseki\'s actions and Suigintou uses the confusion to snatch Souseiseki\'s Rosa Mystica.!~ In the anime, Souseiseki is devoted to a lonesome old man, who uses her as a substitute for his deceased son, Kazuki. She is shown to be slightly more eager, probably from a sense of duty, to participate in the Alice Game than her sisters. In the OVA, she is introduced in the flashback in mid-fight with Shinku and later does not hold back in attacking a then-harmless Suigintou. Throughout Rozen Maiden träumend, she questions her idyllic lifestyle, and much to Suiseiseki\'s disappointment, takes part in the Alice Game out of devotion to Rozen, to fulfill his wish of finding Alice and relieve his perceived grief.    ~!She battles Suigintou, but is defeated and loses her Rosa Mystica.!~  ~!Even though the two versions progress differently, Souseiseki is still the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, and to Suigintou in both instances. However, at the end of Rozen Maiden träumend, Laplace is seen dancing with two Rosae Mysticae, one of which is believed to be Souseiseki\'s. To add to the confusion, after Shinku is resurrected by ""Father,"" she tells Jun that Souseiseki\'s and Hinaichigo\'s losing their Rosa Mystica\'s is her burden to bear. The most likely reson for this is that essentially they were under the care of her medium, which makes sense for Hinaichigo but only to an extent with Souseiseki. Though she is the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, Souseiseki is actually the second doll to lose in the Alice Game.!~  ~!Recently in the manga, Souseiseki\'s body was missing from her case. It was found out that Kirakishou used Souseiseki\'s body to be able to set foot on the human world. Kirakishou tried to stop Shinku, Suigintou and Suiseiseki from retrieving back Souseiseki\'s body by forcing older Jun to be her medium and permanently having that body. Though Jun accidentally made a contract on Suiseiseki\'s ring, which was sooner found out that it was Souseiseki\'s ring, Kirakishou started leaving her body. The only step needed to bring Souseiseki back is to get her rosa mystica from Suigintou.   Due to Suigintou\'s stuborness, she didn\'t give it back resulting Suiseiseki putting her own rosa mystica in her twin. They soon meet Souseiseki, revieved, with Suiseiseki, lifeless. Suigintou was telling Shinku that the Souseiseki they are seeing is a trap of the 7th doll, which the truth is not. According to Souseiseki, Rozen used to say that among seven rosa mysticas, the only two allocated to Suiseiseki and Souseiseki were different from others, by chance they were mutually paired in the begining and they were also called twin stones. Therefore, Suiseiseki took a chance on putting her rosa mystica into Souseiseki\'s body as substitution with knowledge of a risk of failure.  Suigintou described that Souseiseki\'s approach as unbeautiful. Souseiseki not just agreed with her but also thought that she needs to get the rosa mystica back to where it should be. Still, she intended not to do that then and there but to prioritized escaping from Kirakishou\'s field with Shinku and Suigintou.  Soon they all meet with older Jun and Kanaria, with Souseiseki introducing herself to her medium (since he made a contract with her). The group then saw a big imitation clock. Shinku and the others were discussing how to restart it. Souseiseki noticed the clock had been made of wood at that time and then she said she may well be able to make it re-activated if she gains the cooperation of Suiseiseki because they are capable of controlling plant lives.   To restart the clock, Souseiseki needed to resurrect Suiseiseki. And thus, Souseiseki tried borrowing her Rosa Mystica from Suigintou only during rebooting the clock by a deal that Souseiseki will really accept Suigintou as a winner and remove the pain lingering on Suigintou\'s body instead of borrowing the Rosa Mystica.  Suigintou first looked apparently unreluctant, she eventually seemed to approve the deal. In this way, Suiseiseki came back to life. Souseiseki, however, determined to tell Suiseiseki a lie for the first and last time before resurrecting her. So, about how Suiseiseki could be back in, Souseiseki just explained it to her as follows; ""Suigintou returned the Rosa Mystica."" And then Suiseiseki ironically spoke to Suigintou, ""I think better of you than I did before.""  Suiseiseki also asked Souseiseki, ""Can we be together for eternity after returning to the original world?"" and Souseiseki replied to her ""Yes."" This is her first and last lie because Souseiseki promised to give her Rosa Mystica back to Suigintou after restarting the clock. !~  ~!After restarting the wooden clock, two branches were reveled. as this is the connection of the wound world and the not wound world. Then they saw how Shinku collapsed and broke into pieces for time has run out. While the older Jun was crying over what is happening to Shinku, Suigintou immediately demanded Souseiseki to do the deal. Suiseiseki was confused and was about to go after Suigintou but Souseiseki stops her and tells her the deal. Suigintou stopped Suiseiseki from interfering while Souseiseki was about to give her rosa mystica to Suigintou. But just in time, younger Jun and Kanaria returned to them with Shinku\'s real body. They explain what happened to the body and how Hina Ichigo\'s rosa mystica guarded the body. Suigintou was surprised in what Hina Ichigo did in spite that their destiny is the Alice Game. Suigintou told Souseiseki not to continue with the deal because this made her think. Though she told Souseiseki not to be mistaken because Souseiseki\'s body is just for storage, and her rosa mystica is still Suigintou\'s property. Suigintou flew away while Suiseiseki was relieved and overjoyed being with her twin sister again.

She can be relied on for the occasional bit of parent-like wisdom. Despite her aristocratic quirks, Shinku is the most level-headed doll living in Jun\'s house.  However, her one weakness is her fear of imperfection; a fear that is powerful enough to shatter her normally cool demeanor.  Father put so much effort into her that she feels an obsessive need to become Alice.  In her eyes, the Alice Game is cruel, and she is reluctant to take the souls of her sisters, leaving them as the lifeless ""junk"" they fear more than anything else.  Shinku does not use honorific suffixes such as ""-chan,"" ""-san,"" or ""-kun,"" except when she refers to ""Father."" Despite her relative youth amongst the Rozen Maidens, the other dolls look up to her as an older sister, and a worthy challenger in the Alice Game. Shinku does have a cute side, which is evident in her intense, almost obsessive, admiration for the puppet detective Kun Kun.

She is quite easily scared of strange noises, and prefers to hide behind her sisters in the presence of strangers. With those she is acquainted however, she shows a very devious personality. Suiseiseki adores the spotlight, and her favorite activities include smashing the window of Jun\'s room (hitting Jun in the process frequently), picking mercilessly on Hinaichigo, and cackling maniacally.

Shinku does not beat Hinaichigo outright; the younger doll simply exhausted the energy of her medium, Tomoe. Shinku then warned Hinaichigo that continuing the fight would kill Tomoe, whereupon Hinaichigo renounced the tie that made Tomoe her medium.

After waking suddenly from a nightmare, she finds Suigintou's companion spirit wandering; upon giving chase, she discovers that the seventh Doll-- Barasuishou-- has awakened.

Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of ""Father"" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou\'s attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than ""Father"". Suigintou\'s desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice.  Suigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Träumend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Träumend finale, she tells Shinku that ""Father"" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.   ~!In the manga, her body is flawed by wings (she is the only Rozen Maiden with them) that have ravaged her back with cracks. Despite these flaws, her love for ""Father"" and willpower is so strong that she can use her powers independently of a medium. Initially, Suigintou\'s will to exist was so strong that she was able to move without actually possessing a Rosa Mystica. Suigintou did not consciously make a contract with Megu, rather, Megu came upon Suigintou as she was reawakening. Suigintou\'s strong sense of independence, as well as disdain towards humanity, kept her avoiding having a medium. She is also the only Rozen Maiden to have been defeated and revived three times.  In Rozen Maiden Ouvertüre, her complete past is revealed. Her intense hatred for Shinku stems from the very moment of Suigintou\'s awakening, when she notices Rozen affixing a brooch with his image on Shinku\'s bow. Nevertheless, they still managed to be friends as Suigintou was ignorant of the Rozen Maidens\' true purpose--destruction of one another through the Alice Game--when they meet in 19th century London. Suigintou stumbles through a mirror in the room of Shinku\'s medium, wailing hysterically for ""Father"". Shinku takes Suigintou in after determining that she is not a threat. Shinku not only teaches her how to walk, but also treats her as an equal. One day, she follows Shinku into an Alice Game battle with Souseiseki, and is cut in half by Souseiseki\'s shears. This reveals her incomplete body, and she vanishes into a watery N-Field where ""Father"" gives her a Rosa Mystica of her own at last, thus, making Suigintou a true Rozen Maiden. Not long after, Shinku admits that she only felt pity for the ""poor, unfinished doll"" that certainly couldn\'t become Alice and insinuates that Suigintou could not possibly be a Rozen Maiden because she is flawed and different from all the others. This angers Suigintou, and she releases her black wings for the first time, beginning an Alice Game battle with Shinku. She eventually pulls Rozen\'s brooch from Shinku\'s ribbon and crushes it in front of her eyes. As Suigintou laughs arrogantly at Shinku\'s anguish, Shinku calls her ""junk"" which acts as the reason she refers to the other dolls as ""junk"" (particularly Shinku) and why she greatly resents being called it herself. The fight between the two becomes even more intense, but Laplace no Ma ends the battle, stating that the Alice Game of that era has ended.!~  Along with her artificial spirit, Meimei, Suigintou\'s weapons are her ragged black wings. With their arrow-like feathers, she can conjure up a shield, a large sword, or even twin black dragons. Suigintou can also create destructive blue flames as a last resort in battle. The variety in Suigintou\'s abilities, particularly when combined with her savagely cunning nature, make her a strong player in the Alice Game.  It is noted that ""Mei"" in Japanese means darkness.

As with Suiseiseki, she is a gardener that has the power to enter human dreams, and carries a set of pruning shears that she uses to tend humans\' soul trees. She wields these in battle combined with acrobatic flight, her spirit Lempika and her hat which can be thrown and returns like a boomerang, a tactic she used to temporarily disarm Shinku in their second fight. She also has heterochromatic eyes like Suiseiseki, but the colors are the mirror image of her sister\'s. Her personality is also the polar opposite of Suiseiseki; she is rational, calm, quiet and deeply devoted to her master and to her duties, including the Alice Game. She possesses a sharpness in her speech that is similar to Shinku\'s, attacks ruthlessly in combat, and does not tolerate sub-par actions. Her appearance is not only the most masculine of the dolls, but her speech is also noted to be of the masculine form, using the first person pronoun ""boku"" instead of gender neutral pronouns like ""jibun"" or ""watashi."" Souseiseki\'s presence is much more significant in the anime than in the manga.  In the manga, her master wanted to use Souseiseki\'s power to enter other people\'s dreams and exact revenge on his brother\'s lover, who he felt had stolen his brother from him. Since Souseiseki alone could not achieve this goal, she fights Suiseiseki to gather the two gardeners\' tools, the shears of the Gardener and the watering can of the Gardener, which together can affect an individual\'s soul tree. She eventually realizes that it is her master\'s heart that needs to be freed and sacrifices herself to do.    ~!The dolls present are shocked by Souseiseki\'s actions and Suigintou uses the confusion to snatch Souseiseki\'s Rosa Mystica.!~ In the anime, Souseiseki is devoted to a lonesome old man, who uses her as a substitute for his deceased son, Kazuki. She is shown to be slightly more eager, probably from a sense of duty, to participate in the Alice Game than her sisters. In the OVA, she is introduced in the flashback in mid-fight with Shinku and later does not hold back in attacking a then-harmless Suigintou. Throughout Rozen Maiden träumend, she questions her idyllic lifestyle, and much to Suiseiseki\'s disappointment, takes part in the Alice Game out of devotion to Rozen, to fulfill his wish of finding Alice and relieve his perceived grief.    ~!She battles Suigintou, but is defeated and loses her Rosa Mystica.!~  ~!Even though the two versions progress differently, Souseiseki is still the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, and to Suigintou in both instances. However, at the end of Rozen Maiden träumend, Laplace is seen dancing with two Rosae Mysticae, one of which is believed to be Souseiseki\'s. To add to the confusion, after Shinku is resurrected by ""Father,"" she tells Jun that Souseiseki\'s and Hinaichigo\'s losing their Rosa Mystica\'s is her burden to bear. The most likely reson for this is that essentially they were under the care of her medium, which makes sense for Hinaichigo but only to an extent with Souseiseki. Though she is the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, Souseiseki is actually the second doll to lose in the Alice Game.!~  ~!Recently in the manga, Souseiseki\'s body was missing from her case. It was found out that Kirakishou used Souseiseki\'s body to be able to set foot on the human world. Kirakishou tried to stop Shinku, Suigintou and Suiseiseki from retrieving back Souseiseki\'s body by forcing older Jun to be her medium and permanently having that body. Though Jun accidentally made a contract on Suiseiseki\'s ring, which was sooner found out that it was Souseiseki\'s ring, Kirakishou started leaving her body. The only step needed to bring Souseiseki back is to get her rosa mystica from Suigintou.   Due to Suigintou\'s stuborness, she didn\'t give it back resulting Suiseiseki putting her own rosa mystica in her twin. They soon meet Souseiseki, revieved, with Suiseiseki, lifeless. Suigintou was telling Shinku that the Souseiseki they are seeing is a trap of the 7th doll, which the truth is not. According to Souseiseki, Rozen used to say that among seven rosa mysticas, the only two allocated to Suiseiseki and Souseiseki were different from others, by chance they were mutually paired in the begining and they were also called twin stones. Therefore, Suiseiseki took a chance on putting her rosa mystica into Souseiseki\'s body as substitution with knowledge of a risk of failure.  Suigintou described that Souseiseki\'s approach as unbeautiful. Souseiseki not just agreed with her but also thought that she needs to get the rosa mystica back to where it should be. Still, she intended not to do that then and there but to prioritized escaping from Kirakishou\'s field with Shinku and Suigintou.  Soon they all meet with older Jun and Kanaria, with Souseiseki introducing herself to her medium (since he made a contract with her). The group then saw a big imitation clock. Shinku and the others were discussing how to restart it. Souseiseki noticed the clock had been made of wood at that time and then she said she may well be able to make it re-activated if she gains the cooperation of Suiseiseki because they are capable of controlling plant lives.   To restart the clock, Souseiseki needed to resurrect Suiseiseki. And thus, Souseiseki tried borrowing her Rosa Mystica from Suigintou only during rebooting the clock by a deal that Souseiseki will really accept Suigintou as a winner and remove the pain lingering on Suigintou\'s body instead of borrowing the Rosa Mystica.  Suigintou first looked apparently unreluctant, she eventually seemed to approve the deal. In this way, Suiseiseki came back to life. Souseiseki, however, determined to tell Suiseiseki a lie for the first and last time before resurrecting her. So, about how Suiseiseki could be back in, Souseiseki just explained it to her as follows; ""Suigintou returned the Rosa Mystica."" And then Suiseiseki ironically spoke to Suigintou, ""I think better of you than I did before.""  Suiseiseki also asked Souseiseki, ""Can we be together for eternity after returning to the original world?"" and Souseiseki replied to her ""Yes."" This is her first and last lie because Souseiseki promised to give her Rosa Mystica back to Suigintou after restarting the clock. !~  ~!After restarting the wooden clock, two branches were reveled. as this is the connection of the wound world and the not wound world. Then they saw how Shinku collapsed and broke into pieces for time has run out. While the older Jun was crying over what is happening to Shinku, Suigintou immediately demanded Souseiseki to do the deal. Suiseiseki was confused and was about to go after Suigintou but Souseiseki stops her and tells her the deal. Suigintou stopped Suiseiseki from interfering while Souseiseki was about to give her rosa mystica to Suigintou. But just in time, younger Jun and Kanaria returned to them with Shinku\'s real body. They explain what happened to the body and how Hina Ichigo\'s rosa mystica guarded the body. Suigintou was surprised in what Hina Ichigo did in spite that their destiny is the Alice Game. Suigintou told Souseiseki not to continue with the deal because this made her think. Though she told Souseiseki not to be mistaken because Souseiseki\'s body is just for storage, and her rosa mystica is still Suigintou\'s property. Suigintou flew away while Suiseiseki was relieved and overjoyed being with her twin sister again. Older Jun told Souseiseki that her ring will go to the younger Jun in their world since both of them are still the same person.!~ Her artificial spirit is named for a fragrance by Lolita Lempicka.

She can be relied on for the occasional bit of parent-like wisdom. Despite her aristocratic quirks, Shinku is the most level-headed doll living in Jun\'s house.  However, her one weakness is her fear of imperfection; a fear that is powerful enough to shatter her normally cool demeanor.  Father put so much effort into her that she feels an obsessive need to become Alice.  In her eyes, the Alice Game is cruel, and she is reluctant to take the souls of her sisters, leaving them as the lifeless ""junk"" they fear more than anything else.

He is paired up as Mikan's partner in class by the their mostly-absent class teacher, Narumi.

It is soon apparent that even Fate does not know why she is looking for these specimens of Lost Logia (the series\' term for ancient magical artifacts), but she does not care, stating ""I must get them, because my mother wants them."" Fate is not impressed by her young, naive rival, Nanoha, and tells her that her quest is worthless, but Nanoha\'s steadfast dedication to reforming Fate gets to her heart, and she begins to wane. However, this does not impress Fate\'s mother, Precia Testarossa, who tortures the girl just for not getting all the Jewel Seeds. Fate remains loyal despite Arf\'s protests; she remembers a time when Precia was kind and stable, and thinks that the Jewel Seeds will cure her mother\'s insanity. Fate teleports to her home from the top of an office building with complicated coordinates and a bit of magic. She lives in a gloomy hideout in the Garden of Time with her mother and Arf, sharing a room with the latter. She appears in the city whenever she senses a Jewel Seed, as she has no school and nothing else to do. This is also the reason why she spends much of the series transformed.   ~!Late in the series, Arf finally strikes out at Precia, and is thrown out as ""useless"". Fate finally starts to question her mother\'s motives, as Arf has always been there for her, but still refuses to join Nanoha and accepts her challenge to a winner-takes-all battle for the Jewel Seeds. When Fate loses, Precia appears and steals the Jewel Seeds. Fate tentatively joins up with the Time-Space Administration Bureau, and it is revealed that her memories of the past were copied, and that she is a clone of Precia\'s biological daughter, Alicia Testarossa. Fate doesn\'t take this news too well, but attempts to convince Precia to give up; the madwoman laughs in her face, states that the Jewel Seed collection was an attempt to reach the legendary Al Hazard and resurrect Alicia, and snaps that ever since Fate\'s creation, Precia has despised her. Fate, still hurt, attempts to save Precia, but is rejected as Precia and the preserved body of Alicia fall into a dimensional rift. Fate accepts Nanoha as a partner and a friend, and though she is arrested for what she did for Precia, promises to come back as she will probably be acquitted of all charges.  In A\'s, Fate and Arf join the Time-Space Administration Bureau and go to Earth to team up with Nanoha again. Their new mission is to prevent the Wolkenritter from stealing mages\' Linker Cores (power source) for their Book of Darkness. Nanoha introduces Fate to her friends as a transfer student, and Fate has to get used to civilian life, cell phones and having a new mother figure in Lindy Haraoun. Early on in the season, Bardiche is upgraded to be able to compete with the Wolkenritter\'s weapons, and is renamed ""Bardiche Assault"". Nanoha and Fate meet a sickly girl, Hayate, whom both they and the Wolkenritter wish to save. At this point, Suzuka and Alisa discover Nanoha\'s true identity. Fate is captured by the Book of Darkness and thrown into a dream from which she will never want to wake; a happy life with older sister Alicia and a sane, kind Precia. However, Fate remembers that her friends need her, and says a sad goodbye to the life she always wanted in favour of the life she has. With the help of the Wolkenritter and Hayate herself, they cure both Hayate and the Book of Darkness, which transforms into Reinforce, Hayate\'s partner and weapon.  In an epilogue taking place six years later, Fate is older, has been adopted by Lindy, and working for the TSAB along with Nanoha and Hayate. She has changed her name to Fate T. Harlaown, the T presumably an abbreviation for Testarossa.  In StrikerS, Fate is a 19-year-old commissioned officer of the TSAB. She lives on Earth in Uminari City with Lindy, who has retired from her position as Admiral, having had too much excitement and seeking a desk job. Fate goes to school with Nanoha, Hayate, Suzuka, and Alisa. Though early promotional material suggested that she would abandon her battle uniform for a TSAB suit, a recent update of the nanoha.com website showed her in her Barrier Jacket, which appears to have grown to continue to fit her. She also seems to have gained a white cape, according to two promotional pictures; what the cape is for is unknown.

He had no parents, so was raised by his entire tribe, the Scrya, from which he took his surname. He also obtained or created the intelligent device Raising Heart around this time, but his talents lay as a support mage, and so his attack abilities were low and he never made the device into a weapon.  Yūno first appears running from a gigantic monster in the woods and attempting to seal the Jewel Seed inside it with Raising Heart. He fails, letting the monster get away, and collapses wounded on the ground. Yūno uses his remaining power to call out to the nearest magic user and turns into a ferret. His call was heard in Nanoha Takamachi\'s dream, and later that day, she found the ferret in the woods and took him to the veterinary hospital. He quickly recovered, taking a liking to Nanoha and recognizing her as a possessor of the magical aptitude, a rarity on Earth. Later that night, he calls out to Nanoha again and she leaves the house and finds the Yūno-ferret cornered by the same monster. He entrusts her with his weapon, Raising Heart, and seeing her raw power when she activated it, deduces that she can create magical armour and turn Raising Heart into a weapon of her design. She does so and begins her journey to seal away Jewel Seeds.  It turns out that Yūno discovered the Seeds on an excavation, but officials of the Time-Space Administration Bureau lost them on Earth. Though Yūno searches for the Seeds while Nanoha is busy, and though he fears that she is too inexperienced, he quickly recognizes that she is more powerful than anyone he has ever seen. When Fate arrives on the scene, Yūno begins to fight Fate\'s familiar Arf while Nanoha is busy with her rival. This is the first time that Yūno is referred to as Nanoha\'s familiar, but Nanoha replies with ""We\'re friends,"" a line later echoed in the first episode of A\'s, under different circumstances. This whole time, Nanoha is unaware that Yūno is a human male, leading to a running gag of some embarrassing situations with girls changing and especially during the onsen episode, and every time he panics and looks away. In episode 8, though, Yūno reveals his identity to Nanoha. Once Lindy Harlaown and her crew arrive to deal with the situation, Yūno convinces her to allow him and Nanoha to continue their retrieval mission and is let off with a slap on the wrist when he ignores orders and allows Nanoha to help Fate seal six Jewel Seeds at once.  At the end, he, Nanoha, Chrono, Arf and finally Fate team up to defeat the real enemy, the adamantly insane Precia Testarossa. Yūno cannot return to his own world for at least 6 months due to the aftereffects of the collapse of the Garden of Time, so he remains as Nanoha\'s pet. However, just before the start of A\'s, he returns to work with the TSAB and help with the trial of Fate and Arf.  Yūno finishes up helping Fate with her trial, and he still does not get along with Chrono, due to their rivalry over Nanoha. When news comes that the most sought-after Lost Logia, the Book of Darkness has surfaced, the Asura mobilizes to retrieve it, and once Yūno and company learn that it is in Uminari City, they take the assignment right away, Fighting off the Wolkenritter, who take the Linker Cores (magical power sources) of unsuspecting mages to complete the Book, Yūno becomes more and more useful in both forms as a backup and overall white mage; his counterpart in the opposition is Shamal. Yūno also resumes his civilian life as Nanoha\'s pet, and is subsequently showered with attention by Nanoha\'s friends and family. Unlike in Nanoha, humor in A\'s at his expense is less common, save for deadpan jokes from Chrono[2] and a gag scene where Nanoha dreams of eating baked sweet potatoes but instead bites Yūno in her sleep[3].  In the epilogue which takes place six years later, Yūno continues to work for the TSAB as chief librarian of the Infinity Library, now wears glasses, and is confirmed to support Nanoha and Fate\'s relationship from the distance.  Yūno returns in episode 7 of StrikerS during an auction of several Relics at a hotel. Due to his position as chief librarian of the Infinity Library as well as his experience as an Archeologist, he was called to speak at the auction for his expertise on Magic Relics. Later (in episode 8) he has a happy reunion with Nanoha, their relationship still shown as a strong one. He does not seem to have much of a larger role or many apperances in this final installment of the trilogy until the very end, where he makes an appearance in the Infinity Library.', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}]}}"

His preferred combat tactic is to stand his ground and spray the battlefield with an endless hail of bullets, though every now and then he\'ll dispatch an enemy with his acrobatic trademark move - a mid-air triple spin, ending in a deadly knife slash.

It is then revealed to ZAFT that Lacus Clyne, the famous idol, is onboard the Archangel.\nKira is distraught and, due to Flay&#039;s abusive words, comes direly close to an emotional breakdown; however, Lacus attempts to comfort him. The couple find that they both know Athrun Zala on a personal level, and even that Athrun made Lacus&#039; Haro/Pink-chan (her pink, robotic ball) and Kira&#039;s Torii (his flying bird robot). Kira decides to return Lacus to where she belongs with Athrun.\n\nEven before meeting Kira, Lacus had an indirect influence on the war. She spread her opinion throughout PLANT by singing a song of peace, her lyrics filled with the hope of harmony between the nations. After encountering the Archangel, she expresses a larger need to achieve peace by aiding Kira many more times, causing Athrun to question his purpose for taking part in the war, and much more. In time, she ends up falling in love with Kira (which is seen much more clearly in Gundam Seed Destiny), and Athrun &amp; her engagement is ended without quarrel.', 'gender': 'Female', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Lunamaria'}, 'description': ""Lunamaria Hawke is a mobile suit pilot on the Minerva, along with Shinn Asuka and Rey Za Burrel. Lunamaria typically pilots a red ZGMF-1000 ZAKU Warrior. Lunamaria appears to wear a customised version of the ZAFT red ace uniform, replacing the standard female-issue skirt with a miniskirt. She attended ZAFT military academy together with her sister Meyrin Hawke, Shinn Asuka, Rey Za Burrel, Vino Dupre, and Yolant Kent. Later all are stationed on board the Minerva.    During the Armory One Incident, Lunamaria, along with Shinn and Rey, is drawn into the conflict, but the stolen units escape and are picked up by the mirage colloid&ndash;cloaked Earth Alliance battleship Girty Lue, waiting outside the colony. The Minerva pursues the Girty Lue, engaging in several battles.    During the pursuit, Lunamaria meets former ZAFT member Athrun Zala, who is using the alias &quot;Alex Dino&quot; and acting as Cagalli Yula Athha&rsquo;s bodyguard. Lunamaria's interest in Athrun grows when he re-enlists in ZAFT as a member of FAITH and joins the crew of the Minerva. Her attempts to get closer to Athrun are sometimes thwarted by Lacus Clyne impersonator, Meer Campbell. Ironically, Lunamaria appears not to notice her own sister Meyrin's interest in Athrun, even when the two discuss him.    Later, Talia Gladys, captain of the Minerva, orders her to spy on Athrun when he meets with his former comrades Kira Yamato and Cagalli from the Archangel. During this meeting, Lunamaria discovers that the Lacus she knows is an impostor. She gives the data and photographs she collected to Talia, but omits mentioning that the Lacus Clyne working for PLANT is not the true Lacus. There are times when she appears to want to discuss the matter with Shinn, but she would not when Rey is around.    The Minerva participates in several incidents during the Second Bloody Valentine War. During the Battle of Crete, Lunamaria&rsquo;s ZAKU Warrior is heavily damaged and she is badly wounded. Upon the Minerva's arrival at Gibraltar, Lunamaria has recovered and replaces Shinn as pilot of the ZGMF-X56S Impulse, since he is now piloting the ZGMF-X42S Destiny.    Lunamaria is shocked when she is informed that Athrun and her sister Meyrin have defected together and that Shinn has destroyed the GOUF Ignited in which the pair had attempted to escape. In grief and denial, Lunamaria places the blame on Logos rather than Shinn, who is clearly upset over killing her sister. Lunamaria and Shinn begin relying on each other for emotional support and develop a romantic relationship.    After Operation: Fury, Lunamaria discovers that both Athrun and Meyrin are alive and on the rogue battleship, Archangel. At the Battle of Messiah, Lunamaria refrains from attacking the Eternal, when she discovers Meyrin is on that ship.    Lunamaria then battles Athrun, blaming him for taking her sister Meyrin away. He badly damages Lunamaria's mobile suit, the Impulse, with his ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice. Because Lunamaria is getting beaten, Shinn enters SEED Mode and attacks Athrun with his ZGMF-X42S Destiny. Lunamaria interposes herself between the two, trying to get them to stop fighting. Shinn is too enraged to understand what Lunamaria has done, but Athrun enters SEED Mode, blocks Shinn's attack, and saves Lunamaria. Athrun then cripples Shinn's mobile suit and Shinn crashes on the surface of the moon. Lunamaria lands her damaged Impulse nearby and ends up holding a tearful Shinn in her arms, as they watch the Requiem superweapon explode and then the ZAFT fortress, Messiah, crash into the Moon.    In Gundam SEED Destiny &quot;Final Plus&quot;, both stranded pilots are later rescued by Athrun Zala in the Infinite Justice.

She is also in love with him.  As a minor note, when The Alternative World was released in North America through Pioneer Animation (or Geneon, as it is now called), her name was written as ""Qawool"" and ""Qawoor"" on the packaging (the spelling used depended on the volume.) Ostensibly, this was done to make her name sound more native to El-Hazard, since ""Qawool"" can be hard for English speakers to distinguish from ""Kaoru,"" a very common name in Japan. It may also be an attempt to represent the ""ku-sub-a"" phoneme that begins her name.  Qawool was introduced in The Alternative World and does not appear in The Wanderers.

He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed\'s primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a ""hero of the people"" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn\'t seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al\'s suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4\'11""), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed\'s ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\n~!Born to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward\'s first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad\'s formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi\'s intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the ""One is All, All is One"" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God\'s domain and peeking at the Gate\'s vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al\'s soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy\'s life.\n\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbells\' in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemists and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get his younger brother\'s body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults 3 years.!~', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}]}}"

Tasuki&#039;s primary weapon is a flame throwing Tessen, an iron fan used for fighting which is eventually upgraded to become a diamond fan that could only be used by Tasuki by Taitsukun. Additionally, he is skilled in judo, archery, swordsmanship, and is briefly capable of using ofuda. As a Celestial Warrior, he possesses superhuman speed and known as Genrou or Huang-Lang (幻狼|&quot;Phantom Wolf&quot;) because of his wolf-like appearance.    At a young age Tasuki found his calling as a bandit when Hakurō, the chief bandit of Mount Reikaku, took him under his wing. He began to improve his martial arts abilities in hopes of living up to and carrying on the role of his mentor[2]. He and fellow bandit Kōji eventually master the use of an iron fan in combat.

He is a frequent source of comic relief in the series and enjoys joking around. Tasuki values his friends greatly and will not hesitate to kill those who would try to endanger them or make fun of them in any way. Despite being rough around the edges, Tasuki shares a particularly strong relationship with Chiriko. Tasuki, as the youngest child and only son of a family with five older sisters, an aggressive mother, and timid father, happily accepts the role of an older brother figure to Chiriko, who looks up to him and strives to become a &quot;manly man&quot; like Tasuki. Of all the Suzaku Celestial Warriors, he takes the deaths of his comrades the hardest and openly cries for them.

As the youngest and only son in a family with strong females and a weak father, Tasuki claims to hate women. But he demonstrates outstanding loyalty to Miaka and would die to protect her.

Hakkai is often reluctant to do so due to the possible danger to his friends.<br><br>\n\nOut of Sanzo\'s companions, as well as Sanzo himself, Hakkai is the one who takes care of most of the group\'s basic tasks: cleaning up after them, shopping, cooking, etc. The jeep Hakkai drives is actually his small magical dragon companion, Hakuryuu.\n\n__Backstory:__\n~!Long before the journey to the west, Hakkai was known as the human Cho Gonou, an orphan who later met and mutually fell in love with his twin sister, Cho Kanan. He was a teacher in the village that they later lived in together. One day Gonou returned from work to find that the townspeople had given Kanan as an offering to the centipede demon Hyakuganmaou. From their perspective, she was ""the most expendable of the women"", as she had no family other than Gonou.<br><br>\n\nEnraged, Gonou slaughtered a large number of townsfolk before journeying to the demon\'s castle. There, he killed every demon he found single-handedly. Upon finding the imprisoned Kanan, he wanted to free her and take her home with him. She refused. Having been unwillingly impregnated by the demon king, she stole and used Gonou\'s blade to she killed herself in front of him.<br><br>\n\nThe distraught Cho Gonou was found by the remaining son of Hyakuganmaou, Chin Yisou, who attacked him, slicing his belly. Wanting to find out whether or not a tale that he\'d heard was true, Chin Yisou dripped his own blood into Gonou\'s wound. Having now bathed in the blood of 1,000 demons, Gonou turned into one himself, killing Yisou before leaving the castle. The wounded Cho Gonou was saved physically by the half-demon Sha Gojyo and spiritually by Genjou Sanzo. As a symbol of his rebirn, he took on the name of Cho Hakkai.<br><br>\n\nHe and Gojyo became very good friends and roommates due to their experiences together before the journey to the West. Hakkai often still reflects on his past pain, and his memories of Kanan are bittersweet.!~\n\n__Saiyuki Gaiden:__\n~!In his previous life, Hakkai was a god known as Field Marshal Tenpou, an eccentric military man who was fond of his library of books, many of which were about the world below. He could often be found with his nose in a book (or buried under them) in his library. He was close friends with his subordinate General Kenren, as well as Konzen Douji. He and Kenren were fairly inseparable and had an easy-going relationship despite their difference in rank. Although Tenpou tended to be mild-mannered, when provoked he was not to be taken lightly and would fiercely defend those he cared about, qualities that he carried over into his next life. Tenpou\'s weapon of choice was the katana.!~\n\n<br><br>(__Source:__ Saiyuki.wikia & _Saiyuki Reload Graffiti_ booklet)', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Goku'}, 'description': '__Height:__ 162 cm (5\'4"")\n\nPerpetually hungry, energetic, and playful, Goku is Sanzo\'s constant compansion—viewing him as the ""sun"" around which his world revolves. He is neither a demon nor human, but is a heretic born from the Earth itself. Along with his incredible strength and speed, he uses his _nyoibou_ (extendable staff) to fight demons in battle. Tasked by the _Sanbutsushin_ (Three Aspects) and Kanzeon Bosatsu to accompany Sanzo on his journey, Goku is often seen trading insults with Gojyo or fighting with him over food.\n\n~!The diadem that Goku wears on his head is actually a limiter to suppress his true form, the Seiten Taisei, or the Sage Equal to Heaven. When in this form, Goku is incredibly powerful and nearly unstoppable. He usually can\'t distinguish between friend or foe in this form, and often turns his attack toward his companions. Sanzo is capable of conjuring Goku\'s limiter in the event that it breaks.!~\n\n__Backstory:__  ~!Previously, he was taken from where he dwelled on Earth into Heaven due to his potential danger. Shortly after his arrival, he was placed under the care of the god Konzen Douji, who he was drawn to because of his great beauty and golden hair that reminded Goku of the sun in the world below. Goku soon befriended the war prince Nataku as well as Konzen\'s friend Tenpou and his companion General Kenren.   Unfortunately, Goku became embroiled in the politics of Heaven. Due to the stress of certain events, Goku\'s limiter broke, causing him to revert to his true form. He killed a number of gods who tried to attack him, and his three friends Konzen, Tenpou, and Kenren, took him and fled. After the deaths of Goku\'s companions [the circumstances of which have yet to be revealed], his memories were sealed and he was imprisoned on Earth at the base of a mountain for his crimes against Heaven. Centuries later, Genjo Sanzo was drawn to the place that Goku was imprisoned by the sound of his \'voice.\' The monk reached out to Goku, and the chains that bound him and the bars that confined him vanished. Since then, Goku has always been at Sanzo\'s side, not realizing that he has been reunited with the caretaker that he adored so long ago, as well as the two friends [Hakkai and Gojyo] that he lost.!~\n\n<br><br>(__Source:__ Saiyuki.wikia & _Saiyuki Reload Graffiti_ booklet)', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Gojou'}, 'description': '__Height:__ 184 cm (6\'0"")\n\nGojyo is a half-demon, made obvious by his red hair and eyes, who loves to gamble and is fond of women looking for a good time. He is often teased by Goku and Sanzo due to his lecherous behavior. However, he is a loyal and reliable friend who will go through extreme lengths for them when the need arises. His weapon in battle is a _shakujou_, a staff with a crescent-moon shaped blade attached to the end by a chain that can be elongated.\n\n__Backstory:__\n~!When he was a boy, Gojyo lived in a rather unhappy home. His demon father had had an affair with a human, later leaving his illegitimate child with his demon wife before abandoning her. His stepmother was the only mother that Gojyo had ever known. He used to despise his red hair, since it represented the things that his mother hated about him. No matter how hard Gojyo tried, he was unable to win his mother\'s affection, and was as tormented by the sight of her tears as he was by the fact she was only ever able to love his older half-brother, Jien. She frequently took out her frustrations on Gojyo, physically and mentally abusing him while weeping for herself and her situation.\n\nAlthough Jien often tried to protect Gojyo from his mother\'s rage, there came the day when Gojyo\'s stepmother reached her limits and attempted to kill Gojyo, scarring the side of his face with her claws before attempting to strangle him. Gojyo was saved by Jien, who tearfully killed his mother before fleeing, leaving Gojyo alone.<br><br>\n\nGojyo later made his way in the world by being involved in shady activity with his friend Banri and mastering gambling at cards. He survived the loneliness of the nights by bedding women. One night on his way home from a bar, Gojyo came upon the bleeding form of Cho Gonou. He took the unconscious man back to his home and nursed him back to health. He was the first one to whom Gonou confessed his crimes, bonding with the troubled newly-born demon over their different yet shared pain.<br><br>\n\nGojyo tried to protect Gonou from Sanzo when the monk came to bring Gonou back with him for judgment. After some struggle, Gonou left with Sanzo, who later informed him that Gonou had died. Not realising that Gonou\'s death was symbolic, Gojyo cut off his long locks as a sign of mourning. He was later reunited with Gonou, now known as Cho Hakkai. The two of them became good friends and roommates before embarking on the journey West with Sanzo several years later.!~\n\n__Saiyuki Gaiden:__\n~!In Gojyo\'s previous life, he was known as General Kenren, a boisterous and flirtatious god who lacked respect for all of his superior officers other than his friend Tenpou. He was fond of women, but was even fonder of sake, which he was often found sipping while lounging in one of Heaven\'s cherry blossom trees.!~\n\n<br><br>(__Source:__ Saiyuki.wikia & _Saiyuki Reload Graffiti_ booklet)', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Sanzou'}, 'description': '__Height:__ 176.5 cm (5\'9"")\n\nGenjou Sanzo, commonly referred to as simply Sanzo, is hardly the traditional image of a Buddhist priest; he is ill-tempered, swears, eats meat, drinks, and is usually seen with a cigarette hanging from his lips. As a Sanzo priest, he is tasked with protecting the sacred Maten Scripture, one of The Founding Scriptures of Heaven and Earth. The Maten\'s government over evil and the principle of yin allows Sanzo to banish demons and purify evil. Sanzo also possesses a Smith & Wesson _shoureijuu_ (banishing gun), which he is often seen wielding in battle.<br><br>\n\nAt the start of the story, he was bidden by the _Sanbutsushin_ (Three Aspects) and Kanzeon Bosatsu to journey to India with his three companions to stop the resurrection of the demon King Gyumaoh.\n\n__Backstory:__\n~!Before Sanzo was bestowed his present title, he was known as Kouryuu, the river orphan. He was found by his mentor Koumyou Sanzo when he was just a baby, abandoned to float downstream. Koumyou raised and taught him, and was held by Kouryuu in high regard.  Shortly after Kouryuu was named as Koumyou\'s successor, Koumyou was killed while protecting Kouryuu from demons that were raiding their temple looking for the holy scriptures. They succeeded in stealing the Seiten Scripture that Koumyou bore, but left behind the Maten Scripture.<br><br>\n\nThe young Genjou Sanzo subsequently went on a search to recover his master\'s stolen scripture, but was unsuccessful. Several years later, he came under the employ of the _Sanbutsushin_ in order for them to help him with his task.  Although he remembers his master fondly, Sanzo is often haunted by the memory of Koumyou\'s death. He despises the rain due to how it poured on the night of his master\'s death, and often broods whenever it falls from the sky, usually refusing to go out into it.<br><br>\n\nDespite Sanzo\'s undeniable abilities, he often feels as though he is unworthy of the title that his master bestowed upon him. He strives to become strong enough to one day see himself as deserving of it.!~\n\n__Saiyuki Gaiden:__\n~!In his previous life, Sanzo was the god Konzen Douji, the nephew of the Merciful Goddess Kanzeon, who is often seen watching over Sanzo and his group from her place in heaven. He was an ill-tempered bureaucrat who had no joy or excitement in his immortal life until it was turned upside down by being named the caretaker of the young Son Goku.

From capturing criminals to searching deep within uncharted lands for any lost treasures. Gon is a young boy whose father disappeared long ago, being a Hunter. He believes if he could also follow his father's path, he could one day reunite with him.<br><br>\nAfter becoming 12, Gon leaves his home and takes on the task of entering the Hunter exam, notorious for its low success rate and high probability of death to become an official Hunter. He befriends the revenge-driven Kurapika, the doctor-to-be Leorio and the rebellious ex-assassin Killua in the exam, with their friendship prevailing throughout the many trials and threats they come upon taking on the dangerous career of a Hunter. Based on the manga by Togashi Yoshihiro.

He never knew his father was alive, much less a hunter until he met [Kite](https://anilist.co/character/20594/Kite); a hunter who was also looking for Ging. From this point on, he became determined to find his father and decided to take the Hunter exam to do so. He became friends with [Killua](https://anilist.co/character/27/Killua-Zoldyck) almost instantly when they met at the Hunter exam. Gon\'s an innocent and naive boy who is willing to help anyone, especially his friends. He rarely ever looks at anything in a bad way. His curious and naive personality often frustrates his friends, but this is also the reason why many people are attracted to him. He is also from the enhancement nen group. He usually fights barehanded or with his fishing rod, but Gon\'s fist is usually more deadly than any weapon.\n\n##__Gon\'s Abilities__\n\n~!__Jajanken__ (ジャジャン拳)\n-Rock (グー Gū)\nType: Enhancement\nRock is a close ranged attack, and has the highest power out of Gon\'s three Jajanken attacks, owing to his natural affinity for Enhancement. To perform it, Gon focuses aura in his fist with Ko, chanting as he readies the attack. If he has time to build up his Ren, the punch will be even more powerful. Rock is stronger than a normal Ko punch. According to [Knuckle](https://anilist.co/character/29809/Knuckle-Bine), this is because Gon takes risks by charging the attack and lowering his defenses, which leads to his aura output being increased for the duration of the ability. Gon was able to knock out Knuckle with this attack, despite the latter using Ko to defend himself, and also to send Hollow flying off into the distance (all the way to NGL, according to him). When gathering all his anger at [Neferpitou](https://anilist.co/character/12300/Neferpitou), Gon was able to summon such a great amount of aura that [Morel](https://anilist.co/character/29806/Morel-Mackernasey), the target of the ability, broke out in a cold sweat, later causing Gon to apologize because he thought the attack could kill him.\n\n-Scissors (チー Chī)\nType: Transmutation\nScissors, Gon\'s mid-ranged Jajanken attack, requires him to transmute his aura into a long blade which he extends from his outstretched middle and pointer fingers. With the advantage of surprise, it was able to cut through a defense that had been estimated to be able to counter Rock.\n\n-Paper (パー Pā)\nType: Emission\nPaper is Gon\'s long-ranged Jajanken attack. He uses his Emission skills to hurl aura from his open palm as a spherical projectile. Due to Gon being an Enhancer and Paper requiring Emission, a different Nen type, it has less than one-fourth of the power of Rock, despite the two abilities consuming the same amount of aura, although it can still pose a threat to less skilled Nen users. This ability can be useful for pincer type attacks.\n\n__Limitation Transformation__\nType: Unknown\nBy forming a Vow in a condition of immense emotional distress, Gon was able to summon ""all the power [he]\'ll ever have"", growing to an age where he could defeat [Neferpitou](https://anilist.co/character/12300/Neferpitou). His physical strength, Nen abilities, aura output and aura reserves increased immensely, to the point that the Royal Guard feared he might pose a threat to [Meruem](https://anilist.co/character/23277/Meruem) himself. Upon seeing him, Killua deduced it would normally take decades of training to reach that level of power. His heightened speed and reflexes allowed him to easily dodge Neferpitou\'s Terpsichora which pushed them beyond their limit. While in this state, Gon\'s single Ko kick was capable of throwing Neferpitou dozens of meters into the air, causing them to cough out blood, whereas they were left unscathed by [Isaac Netero](https://anilist.co/character/14489/Isaac-Netero)\'s attack. His first Jajanken blasted Neferpitou up the side of a hill and caused them to lose consciousness, although a few more were necessary to finally kill them.\nHowever, the price to pay was as great as the boost. Neferpitou guessed the ability had been possible only because an extraordinarily gifted individual willingly threw away his predisposition and compressed his life, predicting that Gon would never be able to utilize Nen again in the future. After the Royal Guard\'s death, Gon returned to his normal body and fell into a coma. His body soon started to decay, requiring constant life support, and he would have eventually died if not for [Nanika](https://anilist.co/character/52425/Alluka-Zoldyck)\'s intervention. Despite making a full recovery, Gon remained unable to see and use aura. According to his father, he simply ""went back to normal"", and should count himself lucky for getting off relatively scot-free. Going off Killua\'s fear that the more aura Gon used in that state, the harsher the backlash would be, it is possible that the transformation, on top of depriving Gon of the ability to use Nen, did not require his death per se, but that it shaved away a portion of his lifespan commensurate to the amount of power that Gon utilized while transformed. The repercussions are so severe that [Illumi](https://anilist.co/character/57/Illumi-Zoldyck) described Gon\'s Vow as being ""worse than death"", and Killua was confident any Exorcist would die on the spot trying to dispel it. His belief proved founded when the Hunter Association\'s only official Exorcist confirmed there was nothing she could do.\n\nIt is unknown what Nen types are involved in this ability. [Bill](https://anilist.co/character/138436/Bill)\'s Erigeron similarly entails the stimulation of growth and the increase of aura reserves, so it might be possible to speculate that Gon\'s transformation is an extreme form of Enhancement.!~', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Killua'}, 'description': ""__Height:__ 158 cm\n\nKillua is a member of the Zoldyck family, who are all legendary assassins. Since birth, he trained endlessly in the art of assassination. He eventually ran away from his family and profession to participate in the Hunter exam. He befriended [Gon](https://anilist.co/character/30/Gon-Freecss) almost immediately and has loyally followed him since then. Killua is usually a kind-hearted and playful boy, but once provoked he becomes extremely violent and bloodthirsty. This seems to be a trait he got from [his father](https://anilist.co/character/60/Silva-Zoldyck), who believes that Killua would eventually return home as an assassin. He is also a transmuter and constantly strives to improve his nen ability, developing many interesting techniques as the show progresses.\n\n##__Killua's Abilities__\n\n~!__Lightning Palm__ (雷掌 Izutsushi)\nType: Transmutation\nThe first ability Killua named, as well as the most basic one in his arsenal, consists in him electrocuting his opponent by touching them with both palms and pushing them back. The first and only time this Nen ability was used, it barely seared [Sub](https://anilist.co/character/33304/Sub)'s sweater, but hurt and stunned him for a few seconds.\n\n__Thunderbolt__ (落雷 Narukami)\nType: Transmutation\nKillua leaps into the air above the opponent and projects a bolt of lightning from his fingers, paralyzing them for a few moments and causing them pain. Although the ability was unable to inflict any visible damage to [Rammot](https://anilist.co/character/83211/Rammot) even before the latter learned Nen, it succeeded in stunning [Menthuthuyoupi](https://anilist.co/character/43953/Menthuthuyoupi). On both occasions, Thunderbolt was utilized to allow an ally to strike the opponent while they were vulnerable.\n\n__Godspeed__ (神速 Kanmuru)\n\n- Whirlwind (疾風迅雷 Shippū Jinrai)\nType: Transmutation\nThe first core function of Godspeed has Killua react automatically to external stimuli. Instead of the normal process of the stimulus being perceived by the nerves, which transmit a signal to the brain which in turn sends an instruction to the muscles, Killua programs his aura to send an electric signal to his muscles so as to instantly react to a threat, bypassing the comparatively slow nervous system. The aura can be preprogrammed to respond to different stimuli: physical contact, malevolent intent in enemy aura, or someone stepping in a predetermined perimeter, and the specific response is preprogrammed as well.\nConcretely, this results in a drastic boost to Killua's reaction time, which has both offensive and defensive uses. When Killua used a prototype of this ability, he was able to grab a dart between the instant it was conjured, already in contact with his skin, and the moment it punctured it. Whirlwind is also effective as an offensive ability. If the opponent executes the action Killua has preprogrammed a response for, he will, in most cases, be able to land an attack before they can, thanks to both his reaction and his movement speed being drastically enhanced. When he used this application of Godspeed against Menthuthuyoupi, Killua was able to momentarily disappear from his sight, and struck him several times without the latter being able to do anything, the short lapse between the Royal Guard's aura surging and him taking any action being enough for Killua to preempt any move his adversary could make. Youpi himself admitted to being completely powerless throughout the beating. On that occasion, despite his attacks inflicting no damage at all, Killua's electricity proved powerful enough to elicit screams of pain out of Youpi, as well as to paralyze him for a few instants. When he later used the same ability against [Shaiapouf](https://anilist.co/character/41135/Shaiapouf)'s clone, which is considerably swift in its own right, Killua was able to dodge its attacks with [Komugi](https://anilist.co/character/14313/Komugi) on his back, leading Pouf to fear that even with all his cells, he would have a hard time catching him, and then burn off its cells by generating an electric current between his fingers whenever it stepped into a circle he had drawn.\nSince giving an order to one's aura is generally a Manipulation skill, it is possible, albeit unconfirmed, that Whirlwind makes use of this Nen category.\n\n- Speed of Lightning (電光石火 Denkō Sekka)\nType: Transmutation\nThe second application of Godspeed allows Killua to retain conscious control of his movements. His running speed and jumping ability increase dramatically, hence why he uses it primarily to cover long distances in a very short amount of time. As a consequence, this core function is more affected than Whirlwind by the terrain: Tsubone was able to keep Killua in sight while he was running through the woods, but was shaken off as soon as he reached a paved road. However, even at full throttle, he was severely outsped by Tsubone's motorcycle transformation while she had two riders. The butler estimated that by crossing the woods, it would take Killua 10 minutes to reach a destination about 40km (approx. 24.8 mi.) away, whereas a car driver would take twice as long. This suggests that on unfavorable terrain, Killua's speed with Speed of Lightning is approximately 240km/h (about 149.1 mph). If he carries someone, they will suffer mild electric shocks as long as they are in contact with him.!~\n\n(Source: Hunter x Hunter Wiki)"", 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Kurapika'}, 'description': '__Height__: 171 cm\n__Nen Type__: Conjuration, Specialist (When eyes are scarlet)\n__Abilities__: Emperor Time, Holy Chain, Dowsing Chain, Chain Jail, Judgment Chain\n\nKurapika is a member of the Kurta tribe who were massacred by the Phantom Troupe (The Spiders) 4 years prior the Hunter exam. The Kurta tribe was an isolated group of people whose eyes would turn scarlet when angered or excited. These scarlet eyes were known to be beautiful, being one of the seven most beautiful things in the world. Because of this, the Kurta tribe was constantly pursued and eventually massacred. The eyes of the tribe members were all taken away during the massacre. Kurapika is so far the only known survivor with a heart bent on revenge. He strives to have his revenge against the Phantom Troupe as well as to recover the eyes of his tribe members.  Despite having a heart full of hatred, Kurapika is very kind and loyal towards his friends. He is an extremely intelligent person but at the same time reckless. Kurapika is from the conjuration nen group, but when his eyes turn scarlet he becomes a specialist.  Kurapika can conjure a unique weapon — five chains that extend from each finger on his right hand. Some of the fingers were specially designed to deal vengeance on the Phantom Troupe. To increase his effectiveness against the formidable Phantom Troupe, Kurapika places strict Limitations on the usage of his chains. \n\n##__Kurapika\'s Techniques__\n__Holy Chain__ (癒す親指の鎖 ホーリーチェーン The Healing Thumb Chain)\nType: Conjuration and Enhancement  \n~!Shaped like a cross, it cures wounds by drawing from Enhancement abilities. When Kurapika is in his Specialist state, its ability is Enhanced and can heal serious injuries within seconds.!~\n__Chain Jail__ (束縛する中指の鎖 チェーンジェイル The Restraining Middle Finger Chain)\nType: Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation  \n~!Shaped like a hook, it wraps around Spiders and restricts their movement. Also forcefully causes its prisoners to enter Zetsu, shutting off their aura and preventing the use of Nen abilities. Escape from the Chain Jail is only possible through brute force. Kurapika imposed a limitation onto this chain, it can only be used to deal with members of the Phantom Troupe. If this condition is violated, Kurapika will die. This condition was needed in order to increase the strength of the ability.!~\n__Dowsing Chain__ (導く薬指の鎖 ダウジングチェーン The Guiding Ring Finger Chain)\nType: Conjuration  \n~!Shaped like a ball and chain, Kurapika uses this frequently under normal situations, for defensive and offensive purposes. It is also useful for other investigative activities, like determining the location of missing individuals. He also uses this chain to identify if someone is lying. It has a small ball-like weight at the end which moves in the direction of whatever he is dowsing for.!~\n__Judgment Chain__ (律する小指の鎖 ジャッジメントチェーン The Arbiter Little Finger Chain)\nType: Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation  \n~!\u200bThe Stake of Retribution, a blade on the end of the Judgment Chain, enters the victim\'s body and wraps around the heart. Kurapika sets two conditions and if the victim violates either one, the chain crushes the heart, killing them. It can only be used while Kurapika\'s eyes are scarlet. Kurapika himself has a blade wrapped around his heart, which he used to set the conditions of use for his Chain Jail ability.!~\n__Steal Chain__ (奪う人差し指の鎖スチールチェーン The Thieving Index Finger Chain)\nType :  Conjuration\n~!Shaped like a syringe, upon piercing the body of the target this chain drains their aura and steals one of their Nen abilities. While their aura is being drained, the target is forced into a state similar to Zetsu. The process appears to be very painful for them. The target is unable to use the stolen ability until it is returned to them. It is unknown if, aside from piercing the target with the chain, Kurapika must fulfill other conditions: thus far, he has stolen two abilities, one after the owner\'s Nen type had been revealed and the general mechanics of the ability explained, and another that was about to be used without any prior knowledge. The death of the original owner does not result in Kurapika losing possession of a stolen ability.!~\n\n__Emperor Time__ (絶対時間 エンペラータイム Absolute Mastery)\nType: Specialization \n~!When Kurapika\'s eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency (for a Conjurer). In the manga, Kurapika explains this using the terms ""Level"" and ""Force/Accuracy"". Kurapika\'s ""Levels"" in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, however, his Force and Accuracy for every category is raised to 100%. Thus, if Kurapika\'s Level in Conjuration were 10, his Level in Emission (the polar opposite aura type) would be 4, and during Emperor Time, he would be evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter at 100%.

Kurapika is from the conjuration nen group, but when his eyes turn scarlet he becomes a specialist.  Kurapika can conjure a unique weapon — five chains that extend from each finger on his right hand. Some of the fingers were specially designed to deal vengeance on the Phantom Troupe. To increase his effectiveness against the formidable Phantom Troupe, Kurapika places strict Limitations on the usage of his chains. \n\n##__Kurapika\'s Techniques__\n__Holy Chain__ (癒す親指の鎖 ホーリーチェーン The Healing Thumb Chain)\nType: Conjuration and Enhancement  \n~!Shaped like a cross, it cures wounds by drawing from Enhancement abilities. When Kurapika is in his Specialist state, its ability is Enhanced and can heal serious injuries within seconds.!~\n__Chain Jail__ (束縛する中指の鎖 チェーンジェイル The Restraining Middle Finger Chain)\nType: Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation  \n~!Shaped like a hook, it wraps around Spiders and restricts their movement. Also forcefully causes its prisoners to enter Zetsu, shutting off their aura and preventing the use of Nen abilities. Escape from the Chain Jail is only possible through brute force. Kurapika imposed a limitation onto this chain, it can only be used to deal with members of the Phantom Troupe. If this condition is violated, Kurapika will die. This condition was needed in order to increase the strength of the ability.!~\n__Dowsing Chain__ (導く薬指の鎖 ダウジングチェーン The Guiding Ring Finger Chain)\nType: Conjuration  \n~!Shaped like a ball and chain, Kurapika uses this frequently under normal situations, for defensive and offensive purposes. It is also useful for other investigative activities, like determining the location of missing individuals. He also uses this chain to identify if someone is lying. It has a small ball-like weight at the end which moves in the direction of whatever he is dowsing for.!~\n__Judgment Chain__ (律する小指の鎖 ジャッジメントチェーン The Arbiter Little Finger Chain)\nType: Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation  \n~!\u200bThe Stake of Retribution, a blade on the end of the Judgment Chain, enters the victim\'s body and wraps around the heart. Kurapika sets two conditions and if the victim violates either one, the chain crushes the heart, killing them. It can only be used while Kurapika\'s eyes are scarlet. Kurapika himself has a blade wrapped around his heart, which he used to set the conditions of use for his Chain Jail ability.!~\n__Steal Chain__ (奪う人差し指の鎖スチールチェーン The Thieving Index Finger Chain)\nType :  Conjuration\n~!Shaped like a syringe, upon piercing the body of the target this chain drains their aura and steals one of their Nen abilities. While their aura is being drained, the target is forced into a state similar to Zetsu. The process appears to be very painful for them. The target is unable to use the stolen ability until it is returned to them. It is unknown if, aside from piercing the target with the chain, Kurapika must fulfill other conditions: thus far, he has stolen two abilities, one after the owner\'s Nen type had been revealed and the general mechanics of the ability explained, and another that was about to be used without any prior knowledge. The death of the original owner does not result in Kurapika losing possession of a stolen ability.!~\n\n__Emperor Time__ (絶対時間 エンペラータイム Absolute Mastery)\nType: Specialization \n~!When Kurapika\'s eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency (for a Conjurer). In the manga, Kurapika explains this using the terms ""Level"" and ""Force/Accuracy"". Kurapika\'s ""Levels"" in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, however, his Force and Accuracy for every category is raised to 100%. Thus, if Kurapika\'s Level in Conjuration were 10, his Level in Emission (the polar opposite aura type) would be 4, and during Emperor Time, he would be evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter at 100%. Outside of Emperor Time, his Force and Accuracy in Emission would at most be only be 40%.!~', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Leorio'}, 'description': ""__Height:__ 193 cm\n\nPrior to the hunter exam, Leorio's close friend died to a curable illness, and Leorio was unable to save him due to his lack of money and knowledge.

He never knew his father was alive, much less a hunter until he met [Kite](https://anilist.co/character/20594/Kite); a hunter who was also looking for Ging. From this point on, he became determined to find his father and decided to take the Hunter exam to do so. He became friends with [Killua](https://anilist.co/character/27/Killua-Zoldyck) almost instantly when they met at the Hunter exam. Gon\'s an innocent and naive boy who is willing to help anyone, especially his friends. He rarely ever looks at anything in a bad way. His curious and naive personality often frustrates his friends, but this is also the reason why many people are attracted to him. He is also from the enhancement nen group. He usually fights barehanded or with his fishing rod, but Gon\'s fist is usually more deadly than any weapon.\n\n##__Gon\'s Abilities__\n\n~!__Jajanken__ (ジャジャン拳)\n-Rock (グー Gū)\nType: Enhancement\nRock is a close ranged attack, and has the highest power out of Gon\'s three Jajanken attacks, owing to his natural affinity for Enhancement. To perform it, Gon focuses aura in his fist with Ko, chanting as he readies the attack. If he has time to build up his Ren, the punch will be even more powerful. Rock is stronger than a normal Ko punch. According to [Knuckle](https://anilist.co/character/29809/Knuckle-Bine), this is because Gon takes risks by charging the attack and lowering his defenses, which leads to his aura output being increased for the duration of the ability. Gon was able to knock out Knuckle with this attack, despite the latter using Ko to defend himself, and also to send Hollow flying off into the distance (all the way to NGL, according to him). When gathering all his anger at [Neferpitou](https://anilist.co/character/12300/Neferpitou), Gon was able to summon such a great amount of aura that [Morel](https://anilist.co/character/29806/Morel-Mackernasey), the target of the ability, broke out in a cold sweat, later causing Gon to apologize because he thought the attack could kill him.\n\n-Scissors (チー Chī)\nType: Transmutation\nScissors, Gon\'s mid-ranged Jajanken attack, requires him to transmute his aura into a long blade which he extends from his outstretched middle and pointer fingers. With the advantage of surprise, it was able to cut through a defense that had been estimated to be able to counter Rock.\n\n-Paper (パー Pā)\nType: Emission\nPaper is Gon\'s long-ranged Jajanken attack. He uses his Emission skills to hurl aura from his open palm as a spherical projectile. Due to Gon being an Enhancer and Paper requiring Emission, a different Nen type, it has less than one-fourth of the power of Rock, despite the two abilities consuming the same amount of aura, although it can still pose a threat to less skilled Nen users. This ability can be useful for pincer type attacks.\n\n__Limitation Transformation__\nType: Unknown\nBy forming a Vow in a condition of immense emotional distress, Gon was able to summon ""all the power [he]\'ll ever have"", growing to an age where he could defeat [Neferpitou](https://anilist.co/character/12300/Neferpitou). His physical strength, Nen abilities, aura output and aura reserves increased immensely, to the point that the Royal Guard feared he might pose a threat to [Meruem](https://anilist.co/character/23277/Meruem) himself. Upon seeing him, Killua deduced it would normally take decades of training to reach that level of power. His heightened speed and reflexes allowed him to easily dodge Neferpitou\'s Terpsichora which pushed them beyond their limit. While in this state, Gon\'s single Ko kick was capable of throwing Neferpitou dozens of meters into the air, causing them to cough out blood, whereas they were left unscathed by [Isaac Netero](https://anilist.co/character/14489/Isaac-Netero)\'s attack. His first Jajanken blasted Neferpitou up the side of a hill and caused them to lose consciousness, although a few more were necessary to finally kill them.\nHowever, the price to pay was as great as the boost. Neferpitou guessed the ability had been possible only because an extraordinarily gifted individual willingly threw away his predisposition and compressed his life, predicting that Gon would never be able to utilize Nen again in the future. After the Royal Guard\'s death, Gon returned to his normal body and fell into a coma. His body soon started to decay, requiring constant life support, and he would have eventually died if not for [Nanika](https://anilist.co/character/52425/Alluka-Zoldyck)\'s intervention. Despite making a full recovery, Gon remained unable to see and use aura. According to his father, he simply ""went back to normal"", and should count himself lucky for getting off relatively scot-free. Going off Killua\'s fear that the more aura Gon used in that state, the harsher the backlash would be, it is possible that the transformation, on top of depriving Gon of the ability to use Nen, did not require his death per se, but that it shaved away a portion of his lifespan commensurate to the amount of power that Gon utilized while transformed. The repercussions are so severe that [Illumi](https://anilist.co/character/57/Illumi-Zoldyck) described Gon\'s Vow as being ""worse than death"", and Killua was confident any Exorcist would die on the spot trying to dispel it. His belief proved founded when the Hunter Association\'s only official Exorcist confirmed there was nothing she could do.\n\nIt is unknown what Nen types are involved in this ability. [Bill](https://anilist.co/character/138436/Bill)\'s Erigeron similarly entails the stimulation of growth and the increase of aura reserves, so it might be possible to speculate that Gon\'s transformation is an extreme form of Enhancement.!~', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Biscuit'}, 'description': ""Biscuit is a 57-year-old woman who looks like a 12-year-old girl, and is a master and experienced teacher of Nen.

She initially uses her cutesy appearance and demeanor to her advantage whether it's for information gathering, getting what she wants, or even in combat by acting innocent and helpless so most people will usually put their guards down around her. However, as a teacher of Nen, she has a stern and serious attitude towards her students.   \n\n~!Though in the beginning she was out to trouble Gon and Killua, at the end of the Greed Island arc she acknowledges (albeit, in her head) that she's close to developing parental feelings toward the two of them.!~ \n\n(Source: Hunterpedia)"", 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Killua'}, 'description': ""__Height:__ 158 cm\n\nKillua is a member of the Zoldyck family, who are all legendary assassins. Since birth, he trained endlessly in the art of assassination. He eventually ran away from his family and profession to participate in the Hunter exam. He befriended [Gon](https://anilist.co/character/30/Gon-Freecss) almost immediately and has loyally followed him since then. Killua is usually a kind-hearted and playful boy, but once provoked he becomes extremely violent and bloodthirsty. This seems to be a trait he got from [his father](https://anilist.co/character/60/Silva-Zoldyck), who believes that Killua would eventually return home as an assassin. He is also a transmuter and constantly strives to improve his nen ability, developing many interesting techniques as the show progresses.\n\n##__Killua's Abilities__\n\n~!__Lightning Palm__ (雷掌 Izutsushi)\nType: Transmutation\nThe first ability Killua named, as well as the most basic one in his arsenal, consists in him electrocuting his opponent by touching them with both palms and pushing them back. The first and only time this Nen ability was used, it barely seared [Sub](https://anilist.co/character/33304/Sub)'s sweater, but hurt and stunned him for a few seconds.\n\n__Thunderbolt__ (落雷 Narukami)\nType: Transmutation\nKillua leaps into the air above the opponent and projects a bolt of lightning from his fingers, paralyzing them for a few moments and causing them pain. Although the ability was unable to inflict any visible damage to [Rammot](https://anilist.co/character/83211/Rammot) even before the latter learned Nen, it succeeded in stunning [Menthuthuyoupi](https://anilist.co/character/43953/Menthuthuyoupi). On both occasions, Thunderbolt was utilized to allow an ally to strike the opponent while they were vulnerable.\n\n__Godspeed__ (神速 Kanmuru)\n\n- Whirlwind (疾風迅雷 Shippū Jinrai)\nType: Transmutation\nThe first core function of Godspeed has Killua react automatically to external stimuli. Instead of the normal process of the stimulus being perceived by the nerves, which transmit a signal to the brain which in turn sends an instruction to the muscles, Killua programs his aura to send an electric signal to his muscles so as to instantly react to a threat, bypassing the comparatively slow nervous system. The aura can be preprogrammed to respond to different stimuli: physical contact, malevolent intent in enemy aura, or someone stepping in a predetermined perimeter, and the specific response is preprogrammed as well.\nConcretely, this results in a drastic boost to Killua's reaction time, which has both offensive and defensive uses. When Killua used a prototype of this ability, he was able to grab a dart between the instant it was conjured, already in contact with his skin, and the moment it punctured it. Whirlwind is also effective as an offensive ability. If the opponent executes the action Killua has preprogrammed a response for, he will, in most cases, be able to land an attack before they can, thanks to both his reaction and his movement speed being drastically enhanced. When he used this application of Godspeed against Menthuthuyoupi, Killua was able to momentarily disappear from his sight, and struck him several times without the latter being able to do anything, the short lapse between the Royal Guard's aura surging and him taking any action being enough for Killua to preempt any move his adversary could make. Youpi himself admitted to being completely powerless throughout the beating. On that occasion, despite his attacks inflicting no damage at all, Killua's electricity proved powerful enough to elicit screams of pain out of Youpi, as well as to paralyze him for a few instants. When he later used the same ability against [Shaiapouf](https://anilist.co/character/41135/Shaiapouf)'s clone, which is considerably swift in its own right, Killua was able to dodge its attacks with [Komugi](https://anilist.co/character/14313/Komugi) on his back, leading Pouf to fear that even with all his cells, he would have a hard time catching him, and then burn off its cells by generating an electric current between his fingers whenever it stepped into a circle he had drawn.\nSince giving an order to one's aura is generally a Manipulation skill, it is possible, albeit unconfirmed, that Whirlwind makes use of this Nen category.\n\n- Speed of Lightning (電光石火 Denkō Sekka)\nType: Transmutation\nThe second application of Godspeed allows Killua to retain conscious control of his movements. His running speed and jumping ability increase dramatically, hence why he uses it primarily to cover long distances in a very short amount of time. As a consequence, this core function is more affected than Whirlwind by the terrain: Tsubone was able to keep Killua in sight while he was running through the woods, but was shaken off as soon as he reached a paved road. However, even at full throttle, he was severely outsped by Tsubone's motorcycle transformation while she had two riders. The butler estimated that by crossing the woods, it would take Killua 10 minutes to reach a destination about 40km (approx. 24.8 mi.) away, whereas a car driver would take twice as long. This suggests that on unfavorable terrain, Killua's speed with Speed of Lightning is approximately 240km/h (about 149.1 mph). If he carries someone, they will suffer mild electric shocks as long as they are in contact with him.!~\n\n(Source: Hunter x Hunter Wiki)"", 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}]}}"

Spoilers for Manga and Anime on how the series ends:      ~!As the story goes on, it's revealed Finn had been manipulating Maron the whole time to gather chess pieces to deliver to the Devil. The former half-angel reveals herself as a fallen angel named Da-Tenshi Finn Fish. She was in love with the Devil. In the manga, she is reborn as Natsuki Nagoya, Chiaki and Maron's daughter.     The manga and anime versions of how Finn became a Fallen Angel are very different. In the anime, she is on her way to Earth when she in kidnapped by the devil. He brainwashes her, but then wipes her memory and turns her back in a semi angel so that Maron wouldn't be suspicious. She is brought back to her true self by Maron in episode 44. In the manga however, she went voluntarily to Lucifer. As one of the first three dark angels to become a semi angel, she was allowed to go to Earth with the other two angels, Celcia and Toki. There, Celcia was injured and take in by a priest named Sagami Kugahara (name is in english order).     Misunderstanding the situation, Finn and Toki attacked Sagami, but as they were in their tiny forms, they only succeeded in cutting his finger. He brought them to Celcia, and Finn used a strand of her hair to fill her friend with holy energy. They then explain to Sagami how holy energy in stored in their hair. In an effort to pay Sagami back, Finn went to meet him in cave, ignoring Toki's pleas not to go, and even runnng away after he confessed that he had always loved her. When she met him, she saw a girl frozen in ice, who (through a picture on Sagami's desk) had previously been identified as &quot;Natsuki&quot;, Sagami's sickly sister who died of an illness. As Finn angrily explains, this was not true, and Sagami had killed Natsuki in order to freeze her so the holy ice would melt faster, providing more holy water to be sold. She reveals herself to be Natsuki, calling Sagami &quot;Nii-San&quot; (big brother). He captures her and cuts her green hair, which he explains has far more power than even the whitest hair (believed to store the most holy energy), in order to dip it into the holy water and make it even stronger. However, her hair had the power of a full angel, and exploded, killing many people. She was tried for murder in heaven and sentenced to going through the Gate of Annihilation. However, the devil gets to her first, and she goes to him and becomes his servant.     It is later explained (in volume 7) that the reason was because of a promise she made with Access before she went to Earth. She promised to listen to what he was going to tell her (he was going to tell her that he had always loved her) and chose to go with the Devil to become a Fallen Angel so that she would be able to meet Access again.

She is a young girl who attacked Yuuichi Aizawa out-of-the-blue in the middle of town early on in the story. She was then carried back to Yuuichi and Nayuki Minase\'s house, where she lived as a guest for the remainder of her story. Despite having lost her memories, she remembered what her name was and is sure of is that she holds a grudge against Yuuichi from the past when he visited the city back when he was younger. Makoto\'s amnesia, or memory loss, is much more severe than Yuuichi\'s or Ayu Tsukimiya\'s, but from an entirely different source. When it comes to her opinion on taking in small animals as pets, she feels sad that pets sometimes are abandoned when their owners cannot take care of them. Due to this attitude, it takes her a while to warm up to a stray cat she finds halfway through her story which she later names Piro. Makoto is shown to love Piro very much and will often carry the cat around on her head.   From early on, it becomes obvious that Makoto has a mischievous personality, which leads to her performing various pranks. These are done exclusively on Yuichi because of her strong dislike for him, something she constantly reaffirms. Her persistent attempts at pranks on Yuuichi vary in severity, such as simply dropping food on him or once even throwing lit firecrackers in his room. As time passes and Makoto beings to feel more as a member of the Minase family rather than a stranger, she honestly grows to like Yuuichi, effectively looking beyond her latent distaste for him.   Makoto can be clueless about things that people her age should know, such as the fact that she can buy her own meat buns and manga; Yuuichi had commented once how she lacked common sense due to a lack of social experience. Like Ayu, she too has an idiosyncratic expression, ""auu~"", which she says when she is frustrated or sad; likewise, it has no real meaning.

At the end of summer break, Yuuichi takes the fox back to the hill, and he runs away soon after releasing her, leading her to be angry with Yuuichi.

He is a former student of Shichisei Gakuen (often translated as Academy of Seven Voices), a school for fighters where Ritsu Minami was his teacher.  As ordered, Soubi contacted Ritsuka after Seimei&#039;s death. He introduced Ritsuka to the world of fighters and sacrifices, and told Ritsuka he would be his fighter. Although Soubi&#039;s &quot;true name&quot; is Beloved and Ritsuka&#039;s is Loveless, they fight as a pair, which is considered taboo. There is also a severe loss of strength, and in Soubi&#039;s case, his marking bleeds in battle. Since meeting Ritsuka, Soubi doesn&#039;t operate under the Beloved name, and effectively abandoned it altogether.  Soubi appears to know much more about Seimei and his cause of death than he will divulge. Despite Ritsuka&#039;s insistence that he tell him everything he knows, Soubi refuses. In volume 4 of the manga, he even says, &quot;Seimei is my God.&quot; He openly declares that he lives his life by Seimei&#039;s orders, but still says he obeys Ritsuka&#039;s every order.  Many readers and characters in the story itself label Soubi as a masochist. He is extremely contradictory, and says conflicting things on pain and control, making his true feelings unclear. A popular theory among readers is that Soubi is selective, and only desires punishment from those he deems worthy and strong such as Seimei and Ritsuka. In support of this theory, Soubi shuns Ritsu&#039;s offers to control his life.  In addition to the masochist label, Soubi is often described as having a shotacon complex. Despite the clamor to label him as such, it is also claimed by some there is no evidence of this within the canon. Though, at least in the anime, it must be noted that Soubi is recurrently fondling and kissing the 12-year-old Ritsuka. It is difficult to explain the sexual connotations of their behaviour without resorting to a shotacon-relationship; at the very least one can say their relationship is sexually ambiguous. Whether this is part of a broader complex, is unknown, though in the anime, Soubi also showed a certain infatuation with the male Zero&#039;s.   ~!In the latest Zero-Sum Magezine chapters, Soubi has been revealed to be the Beloved spell fighter imposter.

The cause of these drastic changes is still unknown, although he has regular therapy sessions to determine why.  Ritsuka, on his first day at his new school, meets Soubi Agatsuma for the first time. Soubi confuses him with his sudden intimacy and puzzling claims that he was Seimei\'s fighter. As Ritsuka discovers, Seimei\'s impromptu will dictates that Soubi shall ""become Ritsuka\'s"" upon his death. Ritsuka deeply admired and idolized Seimei, and to discover later there were many things kept secret came as a great shock. It further poisoned his difficulty in trusting others, particularly Soubi.  Despite his young age and inexperience due to his amnesia, Ritsuka is very intelligent and approaches things with startling maturity. The circumstances of his life encourage his lack of innocence; however, there have been notable incidents that bare his still-strong naivety, particularly in sexual love and dating. Despite this, he still has firm opinions and unrelenting ideas about those subjects. It is these opinions that clash dramatically with adults and authority figures around him, most notably Soubi. Ritsuka is a pacifist, and strongly opposes violence under any circumstance. Soubi has remained fairly silent on the issue; however, he seemingly doesn\'t object to pain and punishment under certain circumstances.  Love is an uncomfortable subject for Ritsuka. He is wary of compliments, and doesn\'t like hearing phrases such as ""I like you."" Early on in the series, Soubi says ""I love you"" frequently, which Ritsuka doesn\'t believe is true.

Haji first met Saya when he was a child of age 12 and was brought by Joel to be her companion and hopefully mate and create more specimens someday. At this time Saya was 43 although she doesn\'t appear to be since she stopped aging in 1863. He lived with her in Joel\'s mansion for many years. But one day he fell from a cliff in an attempt to pick a flower that Saya wanted as a present for Joel\'s birthday. Seeing him bleeding everywhere and not really understanding that people don\'t drink blood to remain healthy, Saya gave him her own blood. Thus she unwittingly turned him into her ""Chevalier.""

Haji lives with her in Joel\'s mansion for many years, he growing up but she never aging. In 1883, he falls from a cliff attempting to pick a flower that Saya wants as a present for Joel\'s birthday. Misunderstanding an earlier conversation between Haji and Joel about why Saya lives on blood, and wanting to save him, Saya feeds him some of her blood, unwittingly turning him into a chevalier. Saya feels some guilt over this through the years, but when she apologizes, Haji assures her that he has no regrets as it allows him to always be at her side while she lives her dream of traveling the world with her sword.  Haji plays the cello, a skill he learned from Saya. He usually carries his cello in a large black case that he can also use as a blunt weapon and a shield, and the case also holds Saya\'s sword. Haji also fights with a handful of silver daggers that he keeps on hand. As with most chevaliers, Haji doesn\'t need to eat or sleep, and he stays awake while Saya eats, sleeps, or goes into long periods of hibernation. Unlike Diva\'s chevaliers, Haji never makes a full transformation into a chiropteran form; however, this is by his own choice rather than a limitation of his power. He keeps his right hand bandaged most of the time to hide the fact that its form is permanently chiropractic since Saya injured it while going crazy from being forced awake decades ago in Vietnam. In the opening credits of the final season, Haji is shown with wings, but he does not use them in the series until the forty-third episode.   After Diva\'s death, Haji convinces Saya to live, confessing that he has always loved her. Agreeing that she does wish to live, Saya kisses him. As they, along with Kai and the rest of the Red Shield operatives, try to escape the opera house, Amshel attacks them, ripping off one of Haji\'s arms. Saya reloads her sword with blood and is ready to fight him to protect Diva\'s babies. However, Haji takes her sword and pushes her aside so she can escape while he impales Amshel himself. As Amshel crystallizes, he stabs Haji through the chest and the ceiling collapses on them both. Saya screams his name before they leave.

In the beginning of the series, Yumi is bashful beyond words, very timid and unsure of herself. She first met Sachiko, the star of Lillian School and had her tie fixed by Sachiko, which mortified Yumi. Yumi\'s friend, Tsutako Takeshima, took a cute picture of this and wanted to display it in the school festival. Tsutako got Yumi to ask permission from Sachiko. Other characters often comment on how her emotions \'show on her face\'.\n\n~!After Yumi first meets Sachiko, Sachiko is arguing with the Roses in the Rose Mansion. The Roses say that Sachiko cannot object to their plan, as she did not have a petite sœur. Sachiko runs out of the meeting and knocks Yumi over. She asks if Yumi has a grande sœur, and promptly offered Yumi her rosary. Sachiko thought that if she had a petite sœur, the Yamayurikai could not force her to play Cinderella alongside a male. Yumi refused Sachiko\'s rosary, as she would be accepting it for the wrong reasons. Sei Satō offers a bet to Sachiko—if she could convince Yumi to be her petite sœur, the role of Cinderella will go to Yumi. If she could not, she must play Cinderella. Sachiko tells Yumi that she, Sachiko, will definitely become Yumi\'s sœur. But deep inside Yumi, she feels terribly hurt by how nonchalantly Sachiko chose her randomly as her petite sœur; but despite this, she feels that precisely because she still likes Sachiko very much, she has ""summoned the last vestiges of her pride to refuse Sachiko\'s rosary, and wishes Sachiko to at least understand how hurt she feels to be \'just a random pick\'"".!~\n\n~!At a dress rehearsal for the play, it is revealed that the male who plays the prince, Suguru, is Sachiko\'s cousin and fiancé. Sachiko accuses him of going too far and runs away; Yumi follows her to the greenhouse. Yumi at first thinks that she cannot do anything for Sachiko, but Sachiko cries on her shoulder. Yumi offers to take the rosary, but Sachiko refuses. Sachiko tells Yumi about the arranged marriage, and that Suguru does not love her, but she loves him. After the play, there is a bonfire. Yumi thinks sadly that she would not have an excuse to have anything more to do with Sachiko, but suddenly Sachiko appears and offers Yumi her rosary; this time, Yumi accepts.!~\n\n~!When the third years are about to graduate, Yumi asks Sei if she had anything to ask her, like taking care of the stray cat Goronta, or looking after Shimako. Sei says Yumi is the type of girl who will help even if not asked, so she is not worried about Shimako. Sei instead asked for a kiss on the mouth as a parting gift; Yumi tried to run away, but Sei hugged her. Sei thanked Yumi for helping her pass her examinations, since Yumi gave Sei a reason to live again. She also said that Yumi tried to run away so that it would not be Sei who was leaving her, but the other way around. Yumi realized that this is true. Yumi often gets hugged by Sei throughout the series, who thinks her to be very cute, which sometimes makes Sachiko angry due to jealousy. Yumi finds out from Shimako, however, that Sei would actually be going to the Lillian\'s Girls\' University, which is in the same area as Yumi\'s school. She gets angry at Sei for not telling her, but is happy because Sei will not be leaving her after all.!~\n\n~!After the third years graduate, spring comes, along with the arrival of Tōko, Sachiko\'s cousin. Yumi feels jealous of Tōko\'s closeness with Sachiko, but does not say anything about it. Yumi later finds out the truth about Sachiko\'s grandmother dying.

The acquaintances ask Yumi to play a musical instrument. Yumi says that she is no good at playing anything, but sings the song ""Maria-sama no Kokoro,"" with Sachiko accompanying her on the piano mid-song. The great grandmother applauds and congratulates Yumi for her song, because it brings back memories. She calls Yumi a cute angel, and asks her to visit next year. That ultimately foiled the acquaintances\' plans to embarrass her.!~\n\n~!In the second OVA, Yumi sets up a casual meeting with the Yamayuri Council and the Hanadera Council to discuss the upcoming festivities for both schools.

They now have a complicated relationship.  Sometimes, Yumi must teach Sachiko how to live informally, for example, helping her select her first pair of jeans. Despite her sometimes stern appearance, Sachiko has her own share of insecurities regarding her relationship with Yumi, not to mention emotional insecurities rising from her home life; both her father and grandfather openly have mistresses, unabashedly dividing their time between home and the mistresses, which apparently led to her general disdain for men, as illustrated in the OVA series during a meeting with the student council members of Hanadera, an all-boys highschool.

The only traits they share are that they are not academically inclined and good fighters. He regards Sakuragi as an idiot and both normally fight.

However, his style was criticized as being too selfish, and he sometimes comes into conflict with his teammates for various reasons; this was one of the reasons why Coach Anzai refused to give him his blessing when Rukawa told him that he intended to go to the USA, and told him to become the best in Japan before he even thought of it. When he was outplayed by Sawakita during the match against Sannoh Technical, though, he realized what Sendoh reminded him as a challenge: To defeat Sendoh, Rukawa had to change his style and pass the ball.

Despite having opportunities to join more prestigious high schools like Ryonan, he choose to go to Shohoku because of Coach Anzai; Anzai had given him the courage to win in the Junior High tournament by encouraging him during the last seconds of the match. However, an injury to his left knee in a training session interrupted his basketball career. An imprudent early return to the basketball court reinjured the knee more severely, leading to a basketball hiatus of over a year.  Although he eventually healed, he was embittered by his exclusion from the court, and Mitsui quit basketball and became the leader of a gang. His gang got in a fight with Miyagi, and during the fight Miyagi beat Mitsui senseless before taking a beating himself. Afterwards, Mitsui attempted to ruin the basketball team by instigating them into fighting with his gang, as the team would have been banned from competition for fighting. In the end, Sakuragi's own gang - Yohei, Takamiya, Ohkusu and Noma - voluntarily took the blame for the fight, and Mitsui was filled with remorse when he saw Anzai again. He rejoined the team and vowed never to fight again.

His defensive ability completely shut down Fukuda's scoring abilities. His three-pointers helped Shohoku catch up when they were 12 points down against Shoyo, and again when the team was 20 points down against Sannoh in the National Championships.

Serious and disciplined, Akagi\'s dream is to lead Shohoku to the national championship. His determination is shown in the match against Kainan, where he played on despite a serious injury to his ankle. Akagi considers Uozumi of Ryonan to be his biggest rival, though their rivalry is not antagonistic; indeed, there is respect that borders on friendship.  Akagi differs from the other starters in two respects. First, he is the most academically talented out of all them and is considered a model student. After the loss to Aiwa knocks Shohoku out of the Nationals, Akagi leaves the team along with Kogure to study for the college entrance exams. In contrast, the other four had to beg their teacher to be given the chance to retake some exams they had flunked; they would otherwise have been disqualified from playing in the Nationals for having failed too many classes. Second, Akagi is the only starter not to have gotten into an actual fight, although he has used physical force against his own players (most notably Sakuragi, and once Mitsui after the gym fight) to keep them in line. He is the only other character besides Rukawa able to take one of Sakuragi\'s trademark headbutts without being knocked out and the only other character who has had Sakuragi inadvertently dunk a ball on his head (Murasame of Miuradai was the second, in the manga; in the anime, the second one to be dunked on the head is Naito, also from Miuradai).  Regarded as the best center in the Kanagawa prefecture, Akagi plays as a fairly typical center, using his height and power to score close to the basket. He also has a reputation for being a virtually unbeatable defender. As captain of the team, he keeps discipline among his players during matches. Akagi met his match during the game against Sannoh, in the form of Masashi Kawata, considered one of the best centers at the high school level. Initially intimidated when Kawata outplayed him, he regained his confidence thanks to Uozumi\'s encouragement and led his team to victory.  \n\n(Source: hoopedia)', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Ryota'}, 'description': ""__Height:__ 168 cm (5'6)\n__Position:__ Point Guard (PG)\n\nFamily and background:  There is not much known about Miyagi's background.

Special abilities:  Miyagi is quite short, but he has the greatest speed of all players mentioned in Slam Dunk. He has a great dribble and combined with his speed he's able to tear up the opponent's defense and deliver excellent (no-look) passes to the free team mate. He's also able to get a score at his own powers and his steals are just marvelous. Miyagi is a good point guard with a great sight on the game, he's also able to find his team mates without looking for them. He's the strategist of the team, and thanks to this role and his own skills he becomes the next team captain as Akagi retires to focus on exams. By the way, he is also a good street fighter and has a very good flying kick. (Mitsui told)  Coach Anzai says that Miyagi's value to the team is his great speed and his keen senses.\n\nSpecial features:  His quite short length and the green earring in his left ear. He also wears sweat bands around his left wrist. I think his hair is cool, it looks fine on him. Maybe his love for Ayako should be mentioned.\n\nPersonality:  Miyagi is a smart but kinda rude person, who is only nice and sweet to Ayako... He tried to date other girls to forget Ayako, but he failed to. So he can be a very sensitive person too. In the beginning he mistook Sakuragi for Ayako's boyfriend and got into a fight with him immediately. Later when they found out about each other's painful roads of love, they feel sympathy for each other and start to get along. That's how they became good friends. Miyagi is a bit short tempered sometimes and hates when people make fun of his height. In the match vs Toyotama he gets angry with the opposing point guard, loses his view on the game and almost beats the guy.

As a child, Soichiro was bullied and tormented because his family consists of demon exorcists, and were not well liked as a result. The apartment he shared with his mom was also covered in offensive messages. Soichiro started fighting early as a result, beating up those who tormented him. In elementary school, he met up with his best friend Bob Makihara, and they started calling themselves the Knuckle Bombs. The pair go to school beating up everyone they find until they have been proven the strongest. Upon arriving at Todo Academy, Soichiro quickly learns he is nowhere near as strong as he thought.    Soichiro fights using street fighting methods as opposed to real martial arts. He prides himself on being a thug and therefore he fights without honor, usually with cheap shots, etc... However, he does seem to draw line when it comes to hitting women. After training with Maya Natsume, he learns more martial arts moves including the Forged Needle attack. Throughout the Manga, it is shown that Soichiro and Aya Natsume have some sort of mental connection between them that calls to the other when they are in trouble.    Soichiro is a teen obsessed with fighting and takes a lot of pride in that. Ironically, he believes that fighting doesn&#039;t resolve anything, and fights more for fun than anything else. Initially, he is believed to have an average, or below average intelligence. He is very cocky and gets angered easily, and always has wise cracks. He isn&#039;t very good with being around girls, because he had little contact with them up until high school because they thought he was creepy. When he enrolled into Todo Academy, he fought Masataka Takayanagi resulting in him losing his first major fight. He falls in love with Maya Natsume, because she is similar to him. Through out the series, he repeatedly has shown he has trouble showing any affection towards people he cares about. Soichiro is slowly changing, and starting to become more intelligent and starting to build the charisma of a leader. For example, Soichiro actually gets Kagesada Sugano (almost solely referred to by his nickname asshat in the manga or scum in the anime) to once again become an active Juken Club member. Their initial encounter seems to inspire Kagesada to quit his typical cowardly behavior and fight. Soichiro also occasionally breaks the fourth wall.

In Valeria Country, though the birth of the second prince\'s son was highly anticipated, the birth of twins was considered to be a bad omen. Shortly after their birth, the second prince died, and their mother committed suicide out of guilt for giving birth to them. In addition, the country suffered many misfortunes, and the twins, when combined, bore powerful magic that rivaled that of the current king.  The king decided that making them unhappy was the only way to break the ""curse"", and since both refused to kill each other, they were locked up separately in a place where magic is ineffective and time does not flow: a tower residing in a deep valley; Fai was imprisoned atop the tower, and Yuui was confined at the base of the tower. Both were condemned to stay there ""until the world\'s destruction.""  Despite their unhappiness, the number of bodies dumped into the base of the tower began to grow. Yuui tried endlessly to climb up towards Fai, so they could escape, but he did not succeed. Eventually, the king became insane, and he executed every person in the country, save Yuui and Fai. He then jumped into the valley himself and committing suicide in front of a horrified Yuui, reminding him that their birth was the reason for the country\'s misfortune, and that they would now ""pay for that sin"" by being the only people alive in Valeria.  Eventually, Fei Wong Reed appeared from another world, and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yuui, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death. Fei Wong then convinced Yuui that he is at fault of his brother\'s death and that Fai might be revived, allowing Fei Wong to use Yuui\'s guilt in order to turn him into his pawn. In order to bring his twin back to life, Yuui allowed Fei Wong to bestow two curses upon him, one of which was removed from Yuui\'s memory. Fei Wong then told Yuui that someone would free him from the valley, and that he would have to go on a journey, protecting ""a princess"" (Sakura), and killing any obstacles along the way. Fei Wong then tells Yuui that when he finds a magical feather, he should put it into Fai\'s body to prevent it from rotting, and that he should begin his journey when he finds a second feather, which he should give to Sakura.  Later, King Ashura came to Valeria from another world in order to retrieve Yuui and took him to Celes. When Ashura asked what Yuui\'s name was, Yuui said it was ""Fai"". Ashura later gave Fai the last name ""Fluorite"", the name of a precious talisman mineral, and he eventually earned the title \'D\', given to the highest magician in Celes. And thus, Yuui became the protagonist ""Fai D. Flourite"". He found his two feathers while helping villagers during an avalanche, and decided to use one to create a person, Chii, in his mother\'s image, Chii.  Ashura eventually tutored Fai in magic and comforted him whenever he felt unable to overcome his dark past. When Fai discovered that he could only learn ""magic that kills people"", Ashura told him that his smile held the ability to heal others.

Due Fai\'s first curse, Ashura traced a magical seal on Fai\'s body in the form of a Phoenix tattoo, which suppressed his powers from growing any further, and though Fai protested, Ashura told him that Fai\'s first curse would break after it was fulfilled once, and he wanted to be the one that Fai would kill. Ashura then erased what he had told him from Fai\'s memory.  Several years later, a mysterious and deadly monster began to kill Celes\'s innocent civilians. Fai swore to defeat the beast, but found out that Ashura was the monster. Fai, at first, blamed himself for what happened to Ashura, thinking that ""the curse of the twins"" was what had caused Ashura to kill, but Ashura told him that his magic grows when he kills, and that he always knew that he would become a murderer, even though he was not sure why. Fai realized that Ashura had brought him under his care for the sole purpose of killing him when he reached this state. Unable to bring himself to kill Ashura, Fai cast a spell on him, putting him into a deep sleep. However, no magic spell was permanent, so the king would eventually awaken. In order to avoid having to face Ashura when he woke, Fai used his magic to teleport himself to the Dimensional Witch, where he began his journey.!~  \n\n_In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the chemistry teacher._', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Syaoran'}, 'description': '**Relatives**: [Fujitaka](https://anilist.co/character/3614/Fujitaka-Kinomoto) (adoptive father), [Clow Reed](https://anilist.co/character/3612/Clow-Reed) (distant relative)\n**Residence**: Kingdom of Clow\n~!**Relatives (Spoilers)**: Fujitaka (adoptive father in altered timeline), [Tsubasa Li](https://anilist.co/character/4713/Syaoran-Li) (original self, son), [Kimihiro Watanuki](https://anilist.co/character/235/Kimihiro-Watanuki) (son), [Sakura](https://anilist.co/character/127/Sakura) (wife)\n**Status**: Deceased!~\n\nSyaoran is the name given to two distinct, yet related fictional characters from [CLAMP](https://anilist.co/staff/96877/CLAMP)\'s crossover manga series [Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE](https://anilist.co/manga/30009/Tsubasa-RESERVoir-CHRoNiCLE/) and [xxxHOLiC](https://anilist.co/manga/30010/xxxHOLiC/), and their subsequent anime adaptations. Both characters serve as main protagonists in the former series and as guest characters in the latter. The manga version of Syaoran is based on an earlier character with the same name in the [Cardcaptor Sakura](https://anilist.co/manga/30106/Cardcaptor-Sakura/) series - [Syaoran](https://anilist.co/character/3029/Xiaolang-Li).\n\nSyaoran knows nothing about his origin or his true purpose and aimlessly wanders the streets where he\'s eventually found by the archaeologist, [Fujitaka](https://anilist.co/character/3614/Fujitaka-Kinomoto). At that time, Syaoran had no name, no memories of his past, and was blind in his right eye. Fujitaka readily adopts him as a son and names him ""Syaoran"". The two travel to many countries for excavation work which leads Syaoran to meet Princess [Sakura](https://anilist.co/character/127/Sakura) of Clow Country. Even though Syaoran is blunt and emotionless, Sakura takes an immediate interest in him. Her kind heart and open personality draws Syaoran to her and she very quickly becomes the thing Syaoran cherishes most in life. He is known for his kind nature and his calm determination. At the beginning, Syaoran does not have any magical power, but is an excellent martial artist and an aspiring archaeologist with extensive knowledge of various languages, histories, and artifacts.\n\nSyaoran\'s facial features comprise of brown face-length hair that is slightly spiked; it is arranged in a very basic manner. He has brown eyes. He has fairly regular build for a person his age; a lithesome body, being slightly shorter than [Kurogane](https://anilist.co/character/129/Kurogane). In contrast to his brown hair, he has olive-brown skin complexion.\n\nAfter Sakura\'s heart is transformed into feathers and scattered throughout dimensions, Syaoran is sent to [Yuuko Ichihara](https://anilist.co/character/236/Yuuko-Ichihara) by [Yukito](https://anilist.co/character/3077/Yukito-Tsukishiro). To gather her feathers, he has to pay a price in the form of the thing he cherishes the most - his relationship with Sakura. He’s told that even if Sakura regains all her feathers, she will never remember him or any of the memories they shared together prior to her feathers being scattered. He\'ll do whatever it takes to protect her even if it means sacrificing his relationship with her. Syaoran’s relationship with Sakura has had a major impact on his life. Throughout the series, there are flashbacks of important turning points in his life that revolve around his relationship with her, such as Sakura giving him a birthday so he can have one (April 1st, previously not having one), smiling for the first time, and learning to say thank you instead of sorry when someone worries about him. Her smile has a powerful impact on him and Syaoran has told his father that when he sees Sakura smile, his chest is filled with warmth.\n\n~!Syaoran is actually a clone of the original [Syaoran](https://anilist.co/character/4713/Syaoran-Li) that was created by [Fei Wong Reed](https://anilist.co/character/6729/Fei-Wong-Reed) in order to collect Sakura’s feathers. He is only a body clone, however, and was created purposefully without a heart so that he could gather feathers without any emotional restrictions. In order to give his clone a chance to create his own heart, Syaoran seals his clone\'s left eye along with a piece of his own heart into his clone\'s right eye. The heart enables his clone to feel emotion for himself but with no guarantee these emotions will remain when the seal breaks, while the eye allows the original Syaoran to watch his clone\'s journey.\n\nWhen the seal on his right eye breaks, Syaoran\'s personality changes from kindhearted and cheerful to cold and indifferent. He only cares about collecting feathers and will do whatever it takes to get them, including injuring those who care for him. He is depicted as an emotionless figure covered in blood while he stands in the devastating aftermath of the worlds he effortlessly destroys for feathers.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Syaoran has no magical powers, but later gains the power to use magic by eating [Fai](https://anilist.co/character/9702/Fai-D-Flourite)\'s left eye. Syaoran combines the power of his fighting skills with Hien and Fai\'s magic to destroy worlds in his pursuit of feathers. As with Fai, each time he uses magic, his power increases. When Syaoran returns the magic to his companion, Fai comments that he took good care of it, even under the circumstances that it was being used.!~\n\n~!In chapter 219 of Tsubasa Chronicle, it\'s revealed that Syaoran hadn\'t died, but instead was taken by Yuuko Ichihara into the Dream World. He\'s a creation, and he can only disappear. Yuuko tells him that she also took [Sakura](https://anilist.co/character/49213/Sakura)\'s soul & body there. She asks Syaoran to make a choice on whether they must be revived. When Syaoran asks the price, Yuko replies that a price for Syaoran is not necessary, since this was a price paid by [Clow Reed](https://anilist.co/character/3612/Clow-Reed)\'s remaining magic. Yuuko remarks that the rebirth will not be the same as a simple reincarnation, and that he and Sakura will retain their memories. Syaoran and Sakura confess their love as they are reborn. Syaoran is reincarnated into the Li line in another world, and meets up with Sakura in Hong Kong after waiting 14 years. As time goes by, they would marry and, in a bizzare twist, become parents of [Tsubasa Li](https://anilist.co/character/4713/Syaoran-Li) - the original Syaoran.\n\nAfter another 7 years, Syaoran is ready to send his son to Clow Country once he heard from his wife that she\'d seen the future that\'s awaiting him. Sakura comments on how Tsubasa being his son should not be possible, and even if he grows up and meets Princess Tsubasa so they will be created again, the world wil be repeating itself again in an endless loop. She remembers a moment that could allow them to change the future, and with the help of [Sakura Kinomoto](https://anilist.co/character/2671/Sakura-Kinomoto)\'s Star Staff, they are ready to move on.\n\nSyaoran grants his son the Li sword, his own name ""Syaoran"", and send him off to Clow Country.!~\n\n~!Before dying, Fei Wong reveals that he\'s the same as Syaoran and that they all must pay the price for their sins. Thus, both Syaorans are dragged into a void, along with Watanuki. Syaoran desintegrates (his creator is dead, and so must his creations) and by doing so, he creates a fissure in the tube, allowing Syaoran Li and Watanuki to escape. Sakura Li desintegrates too, but they both leave a feather behind which is later absorbed by their originals. Syaoran vows to find a way to bring his father\'s soul back into a living body and continues his journey with Kurogane, Fai, and [Mokona](https://anilist.co/character/2074/Mokona-Modoki).!~\n\nIn [Horitsuba Gakuen](https://anilist.co/manga/44368/Horitsuba-Private-Academy/), he is [Syaoran](https://anilist.co/character/4713/Syaoran-Li)\'s twin brother who likes Sakura.\n\n(Source: Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE Wiki)', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Sakura'}, 'description': '**Residence**: Clow Country\n**Relatives**: [Touya](https://anilist.co/character/3076/Touya-Kinomoto) (brother), ~![Princess Tsubasa](https://anilist.co/character/49213/Sakura) (original self), [Clow Reed](https://anilist.co/character/3612/Clow-Reed) (father), [Syaoran Li](https://anilist.co/character/126/Syaoran) (husband), [Tsubasa Li](https://anilist.co/character/4713/Syaoran-Li) (son, original), [Kimihiro Watanuki](https://anilist.co/character/235/Kimihiro-Watanuki) (son)!~\n**Status**: ~!Deceased!~\n\nSakura is the protagonist in [CLAMP](https://anilist.co/staff/96877/CLAMP)’s crossover series, [Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE](https://anilist.co/manga/30009/Tsubasa-RESERVoir-CHRoNiCLE/) and [xxxHolic](https://anilist.co/manga/30010/xxxHOLiC/). Her character is similar in looks and personality to her [Cardcaptor Sakura](https://anilist.co/manga/30106/Cardcaptor-Sakura/) counterpart ([Sakura Kinomoto](https://anilist.co/character/2671/Sakura-Kinomoto)), but Tsubasa Chronicle takes on a new story with new histories for each of its characters.\n\nSakura is a person with a bright and sunny character; always upbeat, but at times can be clumsy, and perhaps a bit of paranoia gets in her way when emotions get the best of her. It has been noted many times (particularly by Syaoran) that *""her smile is warm and I could be happy forever about it.""* While she is always cheerful and optimistic when situations overwhelm her, she tends to be melancholic and suddenly turns sober.\n\nThroughout the story, Sakura shows a great deal of concern and a strong attachment to her companions. She hopes for their safety, but when she realizes she\'s incapable of it, her bonds are replaced with anxiousness. Often, she feels that she hasn\'t done anything to assist her companions and insists on participating.\n\n### Feather Journey\nTo cross dimensions, Sakura must pay [Yuuko](https://anilist.co/character/236/Yuuko-Ichihara) the thing most important to her. She indirectly pays Yuuko, but her price is the same as Syaoran’s price - her memories of him. When she awakens in the Hanshin Republic, the first person she sees is Syaoran, but she does not remember anything about him, asking, *""Who are you?""*.\n\nAt the start of their journey, all of Sakura\'s memories are lost. As more of her feathers are returned, more of her memories are restored, but none contain memories of Syaoran. At times (such as in Oto), she comes close to remembering Syaoran, but the memory is quickly erased. Syaoran, having previously known this would happen, never tells her anything about their previous relationship. The only memories Sakura retains about Syaoran is what she learns from their adventures together, along with [Mokona](https://anilist.co/character/2074/Mokona-Modoki), [Fai](https://anilist.co/character/9702/Fai-D-Flourite), and [Kurogane](https://anilist.co/character/129/Kurogane). Despite her missing memories, she knows that she knew him very well and he was very important to her. It’s also clear that she is falling in love with him once more.\n\nSakura possesses unnaturally good luck; both [Chu’nyan](https://anilist.co/character/31363/Chun-Hyang) and Yuuko call her ""a favored daughter of the gods"". This is what allows her to travel dimensions safely. She can also hear the voices of those who cannot be heard, such as spirits of nature, and to see ghosts. For example, in the Country of Jade, she could see Princess [Emeraude](https://anilist.co/character/524/Emeraude) while others could not. She can also see the future in visions, though this ability is unreliable and something she has no control over.\n\nSakura’s personality is passive and weary, exhausted from her loss of memories. However as the series goes on, she becomes stronger and more independent. Syaoran states, even though she’s lost most of her memories, she’ll never change. She helps the group whenever she can, whether it’s washing dishes or saving their lives.\n\n~!In the manga, her personality undergoes a change after the [clone Syaoran](https://anilist.co/character/126/Syaoran) leaves her. As she voices to Fai, no matter how identical the two Syaorans may be, the [real Syaoran](https://anilist.co/character/4713/Syaoran-Li) is still not the one she knows. Subsequent chapters show Sakura with a much darker personality and wearing gothic clothing.\n\nIn the Infinity Arc, the group spent a few months fighting in a tournament, supposedly wanting to use the prize money to restore a world the clone Syaoran destroyed. However, the truth is that she was after the real prize - a robot (who is identical to [Freya](https://anilist.co/character/4986/Freya) from [Chobits](https://anilist.co/manga/30107/Chobits/)) who can let one person alone travel across dimensions.\n\nIt is later revealed that Fai is under a curse that forces him to kill if he ever meets a person that is stronger than him. In volume one, the reader can see that Yuuko was not hit by the rain, nor did she touch any of the people directly; this was because she was in another dimension to prevent Fai’s curse from activating at that moment. But when Sakura receives two feathers in the Infinity Arc, she became stronger than Fai’s halved magic, causing him to stab her, seemingly in a trance. Sakura had a vision that after being killed, he would go insane and kill everyone else, eventually committing suicide, but she used the robot to transport her soul to a dream world, thus saving herself and stopping Fai from going insane.\n\nLater, it’s revealed that she was not the original target of the curse, because Syaoran was. This is explained further in her appearance in *xxxHolic*; she changed the future so that Syaoran would not be killed. As she explains to  Kimihiro Watanuki, her coldness to the real Syaoran was because she was trying to follow the dream as close as possible up to that near-fatal event. The two places where her body and her soul went contain two feathers. Her soul went to the Dream World and her body to Celes, Fai’s home country. So Syaoran, Fai, Mokona, and Kurogane went to Celes Country to rescue Sakura’s body, and then her soul. Her body was saved by the group.\n\nIn a fight between both Syaoran\'s, she is killed by the clone Syaoran, but just before her death, she reveals that she is a clone of the real [Sakura](https://anilist.co/character/49213/Sakura). Her purpose was to map other dimensions for [Fei Wong](https://anilist.co/character/6729/Fei-Wong-Reed), who created her, by finding the feathers. She is reincarnated in the original Sakura’s body in the past, with her memories intact by Yuuko, along with the clone Syaoran. In this life, she is friends with [Hikaru](https://anilist.co/character/518/Hikaru-Shidou), [Umi](https://anilist.co/character/519/Umi-Ryuuzaki), and [Fuu](https://anilist.co/character/520/Fuu-Hououji) of the Magic Knights. Syaoran and Sakura eventually meet and give birth to a boy, who turns out to be the original Syaoran. They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, and then they are sealed in a glass tube in order to await the time where Fai Wong attempts to shatter reality. Sakura and Syaoran, after breaking free from the tube, cleanse the feathers, but ultimately disappear after Kurogane kills Fei Wong. Both clones leave behind a feather, which is absorbed by the originals.!~\n\n(Source: Tsubasa: RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE Wiki, edited)', 'gender': 'Female', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Kurogane'}, 'description': 'Kurogane is serious and extremely perceptive, being able to quickly discern Syaoran\'s fighting ability (along with Syaoran\'s blind right eye) as well as Fai D. Flourite\'s true nature and fighting capabilities. While he seems rather irreverent, he is also very loyal. He is likely the most experienced fighter in the group and wiser than he appears. He becomes Syaoran\'s sword fighting teacher, presenting the boy with the same philosophy he believes in: a sword is used to cut only when needed and not used to cut anything if it is not necessary. While serious, Kurogane is very easily irked by others, especially by Mokona Modoki and Fai, who keep calling him ridiculously cutesy nicknames such as ""Kuro-puu"", ""Kuro-wan-wan"" or ""Kuro-rin"". However abrasive and ruthless Kurogane may seem, he has a compassionate nature and a desire to protect. An example of this would be how Kurogane continually questions Fai on his actions and character, and lets the wizard know that he should stop hanging onto his past and embrace the future with his new companions. Or, Kurogane\'s own statement that ""If someone wants to take away the ones I want to protect, I\'ll kill them too"".  His compassion and protective nature is especially clear when his actions early in the series are compared to his actions later on. He had straight out told Syaoran in their first world, the Hanshin Republic, that the quest has nothing at all to do with him. In the next world they visit (Koryo Country) however, Kurogane offers his services to help raid the castle of an evil lord, and stays behind in battle to let Syaoran go on ahead. Eventually, he risks a loss in strength to avenge his comrades\' ""death"" (they were of course still alive) by defeating their killer in battle. It is noted that after he finds out Fai and Syaoran are still alive, he lost his passion for the battle.  He obtained a new sword in Ōto called the Souhi (Blue Ice or Pale Ice) and taught Syaoran the skills of sword fighting and sensing attacks from the left.\n\n~! At the beginning of the story, Kurogane told Syaoran that he would not help in finding Sakura\'s feathers, since it was not related to him. However, he ended up aiding Syaoran and the others anyway, teaching Syaoran how to fight and use a sword as well.  In the Tokyo arc, Kurogane was involved in a short fight with Kamui. Later, he wished to Yuuko to save Fai\'s life, after Fai\'s eye was ripped out by the clone Syaoran. Through an arrangement by Yuuko, Kurogane and Kamui mixed their blood and forced Fai to drink it. Fai thus became a vampire and survived. Since it was not Fai\'s wish to live but Kurogane\'s, Fai can only take blood from Kurogane. Fai painfully refrained from calling Kurogane nicknames from then on, in an effort to distance himself from Kurogane.  Kurogane noticed that Fai and Sakura were up to something in the Infinity world, but did not say anything. After Sakura left, however, he finally spoke up, refusing to let Fai give up his eyesight to go to Celes. Kurogane told Yuuko they would all pay a fourth of the price to go save Sakura\'s body from Celes.  In the latter parts of Volume 20, Ashura used his magic to show Syaoran, Kurogane, and Mokona visions of Fai\'s tragic past. This caused an angry and betrayed Kurogane to unsheathe his sword and attack Ashura and Fai. He and Fai fought a fierce battle that devastated the room around them. In the mayhem, Kurogane destroyed the body of Fai\'s twin and managed to overpower Fai in that moment of weakness, saying to the overpowered Fai something along the lines of ""I thought I already told you I don\'t have anything to do with your past"". Kurogane then turned on Ashura, demanding to know why he\'d shown them Fai\'s memories. The king responded by saying that he only wanted Fai to ""grant his wish"" and kill him. Ashura then launched vicious spells against Fai, Kurogane, Syaoran, Mokona, and a defenseless Sakura\'s body in order to force Fai\'s hand. In the chaos that followed, one of the massive ice stagamites that he conjured pierced Kurogane through his lower right side.  Korogane is then apparently spared the damage due to the protective spell that placed upon him before leaving Japan by Tomoyo. He then stabs King Ashura, and after the King\'s death the group is seen possibly leaving for the next world.  Fai\'s second curse caused him to suck up the world of Ceres; Fai tries to transport Kurogane and the others out of the small sphere that Ceres has become, but he doesn\'t have enough magic to do so. He only succeeds in transporting Syaoran, Sakura, and Mokona. Then Mokona\'s earring (a magical tool made by Yuuko) was able to drill a hole into the sphere, but only one person could pass through. When Fai told Kurogane to leave him, Kurogane cut off his left arm and left it and Souhi as a sacrifice and rescued Fai.  In chapter 167, Kurogane wakes up and finds himself back in his country, with Princess Tomoyo by his bed. Tomoyo welcomes Kurogane home and asks him if he has found out the true meaning of strength, to which he replies that he doesn\'t know. However, he explains to Tomoyo that he doesn\'t regret giving up his arm to take Fai with him, and tells her that he knows that some things can\'t be protected only by (physical) strength. This surprises Tomoyo, but she acknowledges that Kurogane has definitely realized the true meaning of strength. She then lets Fai into Kurogane\'s room. Kurogane seems genuinely pleased to see Fai, while Fai doesn\'t express much emotion, until suddenly - he punches Kurogane. Kurogane doesn\'t quite react to this, far too startled. Fai then smiles at him, saying ""This is payback, Kuro-sama."" The smile seems like the real thing, and Fai has gone back to using suffixes on Kurogane\'s name. Kurogane grins back, promising to beat Fai up for that.  In chapter 169, Kurogane is approached by Fuuma who has come to Nihon Country with an artificial arm from Piffle Country, however Kurogane refuses the arm by saying that he ""will not pay anything to that witch for it."" Fai replies by saying that he had agreed to pay the price while he slept, and gives up the last of his magic. In the second to last page of 169, Kurogane is seen with the arm attached, but claims that it ""feels weird""!~  \n\nIn Horitsuba Gakuen, he is the PE teacher.', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Mokona'}, 'description': 'A replica of a dimensional god Mokona made by Clow Reed and Yuuko.

With Kevin dead, Shion was promoted to Chief Engineer of the KOS-MOS Project General Operation System research Centre, Vector Industries R&amp;D Division.     KOS-MOS continued to be outfitted and tested, but the core remained the same as in the archetype. This lead to the division spending a great deal of time collecting data to determine what was in her black box.     KOS-MOS possesses several black box components left behind by Kevin Winnicot. Each of these black box features are found in each of her skeletons, version 1, version 2, version 3, and version 4. One of these is her potent X-BUSTER weapon, a powerful burst of energy beams from her abdomen that absorb the Gnosis. Others are related to her &quot;simulated personality&quot; OS and her self-awareness which is more in fact Mary Magdalene resting inside of her. KOS-MOS also has some form of energy manipulation tied to the Zohar. The Red Testament, Kevin Winnicot, claimed that KOS-MOS&#039;s power came from &quot;U-DO using the Zohar as a door&quot;.    When Planet Ariadne vanished, the Woglinde was sent by Vector to investigate. As a precaution against Gnosis attack, the KOS-MOS project was taken as well. Though not fully combat ready, KOS-MOS self-started to protect Shion when the Gnosis attacked. During the travels that followed, KOS-MOS&#039; combat capabilities were fully realized.     Some noticed that at times KOS-MOS&#039; eyes turned blue and she spoke very differently. On these occasions, her power level became much greater, but they never lasted long. The one person most experienced with KOS-MOS, Shion, has yet to see this transformation.     KOS-MOS&#039; actions are dictated by logic and a list of directives. She follows these with precision and lethality (as was seen when she killed Lt. Virgil when he would have lowered her abilities). Some of her directives are a mystery, even to Shion.     An almost human alternate persona tends to come out from time to time in the form of a blue-eyed KOS-MOS.

Kohta has repressed traumatic memories of witnessing the deaths of his father and sister, which later in the plot is revealed to be by Lucy\'s hand when she believes he\'s in love with Yuka and feels betrayed. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder brought on by the trauma of this event, caused him to end up in a psychiatric ward for over a year following the event. Due in part to his loss, Kohta is sympathetic towards girls in trouble and is extremely generous and protective to the girls around him, because he can relate to them and they remind him of his late younger sister, Kanae.  He meets Lucy in his childhood when she is burying her dead puppy and running away from the orphanage where she killed 4 children. In the anime, he was visiting his cousin with his family and decided to go to the mountain to draw, taking with him a music box he had recently purchased which plays Lilium. He strikes up a conversation with her when she apparently likes the song from the music box. He finds her horns fascinating and gives her a hat to cover them up while in public, believing Lucy hates them. He asks her if they could be friends and spends time with her. He takes her to the zoo, telling her that he likes to look at the ""strange animals."" In Lucy\'s hallucination, she perceives this as the reason why he was so nice to her. He lies to her about the gender of his cousin by saying that Yuka is a boy so Lucy wouldn\'t be upset or jealous. When she finds out that he lied to her, she stows away onto his train, where Kohta is initially happy to see her. His sister, however, is terrified of Lucy, having seen her kill several dozen people at the fair. While attempting to protect her brother, Lucy rips her in half and decapitates his father. Before she goes to kill Yuka, a traumatized Kohta knocks her down and begs her to stop killing people.!~  In the Anime...  ~!...Kohta\'s repressed memories are triggered when Lucy kills a whole army in front of him, afterwards singing Lilium, the song that brought them together. He is more forgiving in the anime, effectively stating that she became a monster because everyone treated her like one, even kissing Lucy and stating that he still loves her and her Nyu persona though he proclaims that he cannot bring himself to fully forgive her for the murder of his family. !~  In the Manga...  ~! ...he is truly unforgiving towards her for killing his father and sister. He, however, considers Nyu innocent of her more violent half\'s actions. Even though he was injured from trying to save her earlier, Kohta still decides to confront Lucy again, once again reiterating his desire for revenge. However, because both Nyu and Lucy share a body, he cannot bring himself to carry out his vengeance and instead offers her a peaceful life so long as she promises never to harm a human being again.  Although Lucy initially agrees, a chain of events lead to her instincts betraying her and Kohta once again mortally wounded. She almost destroys the world in her despair, but manages to subdue her violent instincts upon deciding to save his life in return for hers. Upon regaining consciousness, Kohta finds that Lucy is literally melting away from her last act of selflessness. Unfortunately, the violent personality once again breaks through and starts assaulting the world once more. Kohta shoots and kills her at both Lucy and Nyuu\'s urgings, thus stopping Lucy\'s violent rampage once and for all. He names his daughter Nyuu in her memory and is seen visiting Lucy\'s puppy\'s grave over the years in order to honor a promise he\'d made to her in their childhood. He then discovers a note Lucy had written and signed with her real name (Kaede) with Nyuu\'s help, buried near the stone. Kohta finally can fully forgive Lucy for the slaughter of his family upon reading it. As he is crying, Nyuu calls to a girl named ""Kaede"" and two twin girls with ribbons in their hair appear, heavily implied to bear some connection to Lucy and Nyuu.

He even asked her to move back in with him at one point, but at the time she pretended not to hear him because she was not ""ready"" yet, though she still has feelings for him as well.

She is also patient, kind, and nurturing. Like Shinichi, she highly values justice to the point of idealism. To avoid making Shinichi choose between her and his important case (really an excuse because Shinichi has turned into Conan and can\'t return), she has decided to wait for him to finish it, trusting his promise that he will come back despite their separation causing Ran a lot of emotional pain. Ran is also very hot-blooded and tends to act on impulses when the people she cares about are involved; the combination of jumping to conclusions and not hesitating to use karate on those who she perceives to have wronged someone has led to several ""near-miss"" misunderstandings. Early on, she would become violently suspicious if she thought Shinichi was philandering although more recently his confessions have led her to trust his intentions. Even though Ran is in love with Shinichi, she often fails to convey her feelings because she suddenly becomes self-conscious.\n\nShe can be very brave and resourceful when she wants to be and rescues Conan from trouble on occasion. However, she has an irrational fear of the supernatural and is thus - unlike her friend Sonoko - absolutely no fan of anything related to the horror genre.

Holland wears a black jacket, with red and white details. He also wears a pale yellow scarf, with long Capri-like pants that are military green, with blue and white high-tops. Occasionally, while lounging around on the Gekko, he can be seen in his undergarments: a yellow pair of shorts.\n\nInitially presented as laid-back and logical, in person, however, Holland is not always as cool and composed as the photos in the *ray=out* magazine might suggest - he frequently loses his temper when a situation turns for the worse, or when faced with insubordination. He has once thrown [Renton Thurston](https://anilist.co/character/477/Renton-Thurston) in the brig for using the Nirvash without permission and has beaten Renton for minor transgressions. Due to his memories of his bloody past and desire to become the new savior of the planet, he tended to lash out in anger and jealousy towards anyone who provoked him (most often Renton). Because of this, he lacked compassion towards others besides [Talho Yuuki](https://anilist.co/character/1530/Talho-Yuuki) and [Eureka](https://anilist.co/character/1709/Eureka), was unable to recognize his mistakes, and rejected to face responsibility for any of his actions. According to Talho, the only way he knew how to confront reality was to physically hurt those who angered or hurt him. When he\'s not angry, he\'s an effective leader willing to do anything for the crew.\n\nA recurring theme in the middle portion of the series with Holland is his instinct to run away from his past and responsibility, using Eureka, Renton (in this case, physically and emotionally abusing him), and lifting as a way to escape, much to Talho\'s chagrin.\n\n~!His family was involved in a ritual of patricide to ""calm the planet"". The male who succeeded the last one must kill his father ""The Sacrificial King"" and then becomes the new king thus supposedly sating the desire for blood from the world. Despite being the second-born, Holland was selected to be his father\'s successor after his birth caused his mother to die because his father took this as a sign that he was destined to be the next king. As a result, his father lavished attention towards Holland, which angered Dewey, who grew to resent his younger brother for depriving him of what he thought what his birthright. This ritual was ended when Dewey illegitimately slew his father out of jealousy and they were stripped of their family\'s rank.\n\nHe was said to have idolized Dewey and never realized the deep hatred his older brother harbored towards him. His affection for Dewey was such that Holland even joined the military with him, and was made a unit leader. Until three years before the series\' debut, he and his companions were part of the S.O.F., an elite military unit of the United Federation, and were ordered by Dewey to eliminate all the residents of Ciudades del Cielo, which was considered as a haven for Vodarac worshippers(or terrorists, as they are referred to by the military). Trusting his brother\'s words, Holland led the S.O.F. into the assault but he was also given another mission: to capture [Norb](https://anilist.co/character/5132/Norb), a powerful Vodarac priest. Norb was able to convince Holland about Dewey\'s plan to destroy the planet by initiating another Summer of Love and asked him to protect Eureka until her partner made himself known, which Holland believes will be himself. These events led to Holland\'s (and his squad\'s) desertion from the military and later to the incarceration of Dewey. Because of their opposing goals, they share a deep hatred for each other, in Holland\'s case beginning from his encounter with Norb. Holland is known as one of the greatest ref boarders alive, and is an idol to many young people, including Renton.!~\n\n~!Ever since Eureka was placed in his care when they were assigned to the S.O.F. (an elite military unit of the United Federation), he has been dedicated to protecting her, especially after learning her Coralian origins and she needs to find her destined partner to bring the Scub Coral and humans together. Holland always believed he would become Eureka\'s partner, and as a result, he puts her safety above everything.!~\n\n~!In episode 34 of *Eureka Seven*, Holland and Talho are hinted to be engaged due to them wearing rings on their left ring fingers, and in the following episode, they learn they are expecting a child together.

Previously a top member of the military (as she puts it, a ""military dog""), her character development revolves primarily around her attempts to atone for her behavior and to learn to live without relying on orders, instead of becoming her own person.\n\nA bit of an enigma, Eureka is a young girl who has trouble communicating with and understanding people. She speaks very calmly and directly, and due to her initial lack of empathy, often comes across as blunt. She is often perplexed by other peoples\' emotions and behaviors, making her naive, especially when it comes to interpersonal relationships. She is considered to be one of the most excellent LFO pilots due to being the pilot of the Nirvash type ZERO and used to be part of the United Federation\'s Special Operations Force unit until she left with [Holland](https://anilist.co/character/1512/Holland-Novak). She ends up taking in three children orphaned during her time in the S.O.F., becoming their adoptive mother.\n\n~!The Special Operations Force is known for its role in the Cuidades del Cielo massacre, which occurred three years before the series beginning. The S.O.F. stormed into the city based on [Dewey](https://anilist.co/character/4005/Dewey-Novak)\'s claims that the Vodarac people were protecting the Coralians, which led them to be labeled as terrorists, and it led to numerous fatalities. However, once Holland discovered Dewey\'s true intentions from [Norb](https://anilist.co/character/5132/Norb), he quit the military, taking Eureka, [Talho](https://anilist.co/character/1530/Talho-Yuuki), [Ken-Goh](https://anilist.co/character/7105/KenGoh), and the Gekko with him. Dewey was blamed for his brother\'s actions on deserting the military and was imprisoned.!~\n\nEureka is usually characterized as someone who is in constant conflict with herself as she struggles to forgive herself for her blind following of orders and violent misdeeds. She is usually shown to immensely dislike herself; beyond considering her physical appearance unattractive, Eureka despises who she is, or the lack thereof, due to her numerous shortcomings in acceptable behavior and deficits in social skills. She actively seeks to make up for it, treating others with kindness where possible and detesting conflict due to how she has hurt others through it. She also loves her children very much and has a strong parental instinct.\n\nEureka treats the Nirvash type ZERO not as a machine, but as a companion with thoughts and feelings of its own. Initially, she knew nothing about her origin or her true purpose before joining Gekkostate due to her having no memories from before she was found.\n\n~!Eureka is a Coralian created by the Scub Coral and was meant to gather information on the human population. Eureka is a ""blank page"" of sorts, an empty imitation of a human created by the Scub Coral as a means of communication. She was born by the Scub Coral, a race of assimilating, intelligent lifeforms that landed on Earth via falling satellite (which was also named ""EUREKA"") and is, therefore, a human-form Coralian. She was found by [Adroc Thurston](https://anilist.co/character/30855/Adroc-Thurston), who gave her the name ""Eureka"", taught her how to be an LFO pilot, and took on a surrogate father figure to her.!~\n\n~!Eureka\'s physical and mental states undergo many major changes after meeting her partner and future husband, Renton Thurston, due to the strong feelings of love he harbors for her. Even though she\'s blunt and emotionless, Renton takes an immediate interest in her, and his gentle, amusing, and determined personality becomes the thing that changes her character. Initially, she doesn\'t return his feelings because she does not understand what they mean. However, as she gets to know him, she begins to fall in love with him and realizes she wants to be together with him forever. She eventually marries him shortly after *Eureka Seven* and is listed as ""Eureka Thurston"", along with Maurice, Linck, and Maeter, as part of the Thurston family on the Residency Identification paper that [Axel Thurston](https://anilist.co/character/6779/Axel-Thurston) carries around. They got married on April 2, 12006.\n\nIn *Eureka Seven: AO*, Eureka has two children with Renton: a daughter named Amber Thurston (who died three months after birth), and a son named [Ao Fukai](https://anilist.co/character/53897/Ao-Fukai).!~\n\n~!Eureka becomes passive and weary due to her feelings that Renton can pilot the Nirvash better than her, causing her to feel unwanted and hopeless. This also caused her to reject and ignore Renton, never realizing that she was simply jealous of him and lonely that her partnership with Nirvash was strained. After he saved her from getting absorbed by the Scub Coral, she slowly changed from uncaring to sympathetic as she started to understand the hardships Renton has endured for her sake.\n\nAfter the High Priest performs a Guidance Ritual to release Eureka from the scrub covering her body, she emerges with short light blue messy hair and lacking eyebrows; scars are going along her left side because of how the Coral was absorbing her.!~\n\n~!Before leaving [Sakuya](https://anilist.co/character/5896/Sakuya)\'s heart, Eureka is offered to have her scars fixed, but refuses, saying the scars are the outward proof of what she has been through. Sakuya commends Eureka\'s strong will. Upon emerging, Eureka is shown to have regained her former appearance. Her hair is now loose without the clips holding them back and her scars have become less prevalent.!~\n\n~!Upon passing the Great Wall and reaching Earth, known as the Promised Land, Eureka undergoes her most intense transformation yet. As she begins to morph into her Coralian form, her left arm begins swelling, and portions of it turn a light green. Afraid of what Renton and the children might think, she initially tries to hide her arm and distances herself from them. When they notice the transformation, she runs away. However, the others soon find her, and her secret is revealed. Renton, concerned for Eureka and deeply hurt by her pain, violently and repeatedly bashes his left arm with a rock in a fit of anger so his arm will be different like Eureka\'s. Eureka, while shocked by Renton\'s actions, finally understands that Renton will never abandon her no matter what and reconciles with him. However, Renton\'s injury becomes infected and he develops a high fever as a result. While caring for a sick Renton, Eureka sheds a tear and her left arm completely morphs into Coralian form, furthermore, wing-like appendages grow out of her back. Eureka is once more afraid of what Renton might think when he wakes up, but upon seeing her, Renton is entranced and comments on how beautiful Eureka has become, much to her joy.!~\n\n~!When [Dewey](https://anilist.co/character/4005/Dewey-Novak) dies, the collar on Eureka begins affecting Eureka\'s physiology, and her skin morphs completely into Coralian green before she is enveloped in a sphere of black and red energy. When Renton and the Nirvash Spec3 force their way into the sphere, Renton encounters Eureka who has all but returned to her original appearance from the start of the series while retaining her Coralian wings and she no longer bears the scars on her body. Renton ties her hair back with a flower hair clip, revealing a small green gemlike spot in the middle of her forehead.!~\n\n~!In *Eureka Seven AO*, Eureka has noticeably aged and grown taller, but is most recognized for her maturity and kindness. Her hair has become straighter and is at the same length as in the first series, and she still has the small green gemlike spot on her forehead. While living in the 21st century of an alternate universe with [Ao](https://anilist.co/character/53897/Ao-Fukai) for three years, she dyed her hair brown to avoid suspicion. In episodes 12-14, the pregnant, past incarnation of Eureka that Ao encountered looks exactly the way she did before she disappeared after taking the Quartz away from Okinawa. She also wore a new blue and white dress in place of her old one, even the same one during both of her pregnancies.

She is also a heterochromatic, possessing different colored eyes: one brown and one blue. However, she is psychologically disturbed, having her fair share of hate toward teachers. Her genius is displayed repeatedly by such abstract actions as the detonation of time bombs (i.e. firecrackers in disposable boxes) and making a harmless snake look like a cobra using paper cutouts. Her intellect is also shown through actions, such as shouting curse words in French and being able to speak fluent Mandarin. On the trip in Okinawa, Toshito Kikuchi noted that she can speak 5 languages.    ~!Her hatred for teachers stems from her time in elementary school. Urumi\'s teacher, Ms. Fujimori, while initially welcoming and receptive, wasn\'t able to handle her intellect properly, since she went to a second-rate college, and it was her first year teaching. Urumi\'s constant requests for the teacher\'s time, both inside and outside of school, as well as the fact that the lessons she wanted to learn from the teacher included extremely advanced, college-level subjects (such as differential calculus) eventually made the teacher snap. When Urumi interrupted Ms. Fujimori\'s lecture to correct her in front of the whole class, the teacher then told Urumi\'s secret to her class. While it isn\'t stated explicitly, it can be deduced that her intelligence is derived from her biological father, when Urumi tells Eikichi Onizuka that her mother had selected a sperm-donor, based on his intellect and nothing more. It is even suggested that her mother took the sperm from an American scientific genius (this information can be gleaned from a scene where Urumi and her mother visited some friends in the United States, and Urumi was led into a dark storage room by a doctor, who explains to her that her father is actually just a bottle of donated sperm); this also explains Urumi\'s natural, blond hair. Naturally, this caused a great deal of psychological trauma to Urumi, and quite an understandable hatred of teachers. It is still unclear what happened to Ms. Fujimori, as her last appearances in the storyline was begging Onizuka to help Urumi before something terrible happens to her.   She is later found by Miyabi in a small apartment, and hired to torture Onizuka. Formerly a student at Holy Forest for a while, but stopped attending regularly after some time, she begins almost immediately, as she frames him for lechery and sends him to jail overnight, only to appear in class and on his homeroom roster the morning after. Onizuka\'s frustration with her vastly increases, when Vice-Principal Uchiyamada strictly advises him that he cannot inflict physical harm on her due, to her educational potential. Urumi is eventually able to turn Onizuka into her slave (more-or-less, her ""genie"") by threatening to have him arrested, after she fakes her death when he accidentally pushes her off a building.   However, all this changes when she encounters her Ms. Fujimori again, awakening her deepest hatred and causing her to direct her wrath at the student body. Onizuka responds by bringing his biker gang to school and ""kidnaps"" her from class. He is finally able to get through to her by almost killing the two of them by jumping over - and nearly falling into - a gap at a suspension bridge, despite her attempts to convince him that she is not afraid of anything, including death. Onizuka makes her see past her trauma, however bad, just isn\'t worth messing up the present with (in the manga, he does this by having his biker friends share their life experiences with her). Inspired, she allies with Onizuka, and helps with his troubles.   Despite her switch in allegiance, Urumi continues her feud with Miyabi, until Miyabi reveals her origins to the student body. Urumi retaliates by setting up a web page, where she promises to post pictures of Miyabi in her bathroom (Urumi had earlier placed a hidden camera), after a countdown timer reaches zero. However, the site reveals only a single photograph of Urumi, Miyabi, and Tomoko Nomura during their younger years. Urumi never had any intention of ruining Miyabi; she just wanted to scare her. Urumi attempts suicide at an indoor skiing arena by freezing to death, but Onizuka rescues her. It is after this incident that Urumi considers Onizuka to be her ""favorite"".   She grows extremely infatuated with Onizuka, to the point of wanting to elope with Onizuka. Urumi takes a more stereotypical role of a character that prefers the use of violence, in response to jealousy - she is often seen beating Onizuka mercilessly every time he tries to fulfill his pervertednes. Urumi states Onizuka should wait for her hormones to start kicking in, because she\'s sure that she would have a bouncing body by then. Like Noboru Yoshikawa, her loyalty to Onizuka is extremely strong, to the point that she would consider suicide, if he were to leave, knowing that her own life is worthless without him around. !~ (Source: Wikipedia) ', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Eikichi'}, 'description': 'A hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job.

He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily. Through the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (though not necessarily true).\n\nHis initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki\'s problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.  Unfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers\' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school - in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access - and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide. Onizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class\'s brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\n\nIt is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka\'s true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach). Onizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm-wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series).\n\nHis fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage. In spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he\'s acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing ""where\'s the nipple"" with his daughter, at a karaoke\u200b bar in town).\n\nHis personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki 750 Road Star Z2.

Yasuaki is an Onmyōji, and the successor to the famous, historical Onmyōji Abe no Seimei.  Unlike his fellow Hachiyou, Yasuaki was not ""born"" a human, but created through Abe no Seimei\'s magical skill, and crafted into his current form through that same ability (in the manga he even talks about Seimei using a Tengu\'s power to help form him, although this is not explained in the anime). For this reason, despite having the physical appearance of a twenty one year old adult male, Yasuaki has only actually been alive for two years. This in many ways explains his emotional simplicity and naivety, since he has not yet learnt many of the things his companions have grown up absorbing.  For the most part, Yasuaki is a composed, detached individual that operates largely on logic and is sometimes perceived as cold or strange. When it appears that Eisen will die if he exorcises the eight-stringed Kin, Yasuaki states the fact bluntly and without any concern because he sees it simply in black and white - to save the Miko, a Hachiyou must be prepared to do his duty. As he puts it - ""If there is no Miko, there is no point in the Hachiyou.""   When Yasuaki was ""born"", Seimei told him he had been born to find someone important to him, and that he lacked something as a person - a heart - which could not be crafted. For this reason, Yasuaki has accepted his master\'s words as meaning he\'s not a ""real person"", and therefore does not count in the same way as his Hachiyou companions. He believes he is the Miko\'s ""tool"" - in the manga, he is worried that he is ""broken"" because he can no longer read Akane\'s heart (although Akane explains to him that that just makes him like every other person, and that he\'s not broken at all)  In the anime he tells her that ""a tool that no longer works has no option but to be destroyed"" after Shirin tells him that he will never be able to find the Northern Seal. In the anime, his ignorance of human feelings make him tell Ran the memories that to that point had been concealed from her, driving her back to the Oni clan and causing a lot of trouble for the Hachiyou. In the manga, it is when he releases Kotengu\'s seal and sends him into battle against Ikutidaru, only to have the creature apparently slain at the demon\'s hands.  Yasuaki has many odd habits during the anime and the manga - including talking to trees, possessing small animals to convey messages and even casting spell dolls to help him do the cleaning. Although undoubtedly the most powerful of the Hachiyou at the start, he is also probably the most vulnerable on account of his background and his origins.  Yasuaki\'s developmental stages and childlike naivety are more clearly outlined in the manga, also - at one point, he asks why people tell lies, but later winds up lying to Akane himself to protect her from the grief of Kotengu\'s apparent passing away. This act tortures him for some time afterwards and he withdraws from Akane\'s company completely, convinced she must be angry with him for telling her a lie.  Yasuaki\'s most commonly said phrase in the manga and the anime is (mondai nai - no problem), a catchphrase which was even picked up on and exploited in one of the live Haruka Matsuri festas.

He and Yozak are the only two survivors of the Battle of Lütenburg, and at the request of Julia von Wincott, he was also put in charge of the soul that was to be the new Maoh. He transported it safely to Earth so that it could be born.  Furthermore, he was the one who was the inspiration for Yuuri\'s name. He stated that ""Where I come from, the month of July is called Yuuri"", which made Yuuri\'s mother name him \'Yuuri\' because he was born in July.

Early in the show, bullies make fun of Yuri\'s name by calling him ""Shibuya Yūri, Harajuku Fūri"" (advantage Shibuya, disadvantage Harajuku) — a reference to popular districts of Tokyo. In the English dub, this becomes a pun on ""Yuri is short for urine.""  When Yuri arrives in Shin Makoku, he is declared the 27th Maoh of the Mazoku (""Demon Race""). Yuri easily gets caught up in his emotions to the point of losing control of himself. He is a little bit quick to anger, and once he\'s on a rampage he can\'t even stop himself. A music teacher he once had dubbed his rants ""the Turkish march"". When he is angry or sad or has a strong emotion his natural powers emerge. Yuri uses expressions from historical dramas when he gets this way, which probably has to do with the fact that he loves historical dramas. They call this condition is sometimes called Maou mode (「上様モード」 (uesama mo-do) (emperor mode) in Japanese). In the anime this form can be recognized mainly by the longer hair and demon eyes. He can summon powerful magic (majutsu), even in the human territories (a notable feat as most Mazoku cannot perform magic outside their country), and even more remarkable he can use majutsu in souseki filled areas such as the souseki mines where other mazoku have difficulty standing and even breathing. Yuri\'s magic is manifested in various shapes - usually one or more great water dragons,[7] or some messy magical ""creature"" made from mud, food morsels etc. After spending time in this form, Yuri becomes worn out and in some cases passes out and doesn\'t remember what happened afterwards. Later, Yuri learns to control his power and uses it to close the first of the Forbidden Boxes. In the beginning of season 1, he often fainted after he used Maryokou (especially in Human land) due to exhaustion. But later on he was able to maintain his consciousness after returning to his ""former self"".  Yuri has many allies and friends. His closest allies are Wolfram, Conrad, Günter, Gwendal, Murata, and Josak. They help Yuri throughout the series. At his first encounter with Wolfram von Bielefeld he ends up engaged to him due to a mishap: Wolfram, angry that Yuri has been chosen as the Maoh, makes the mistake of insulting Yuri\'s mother - which earns him a slap. Slapping another noble on his or her left cheek is the way in which Mazoku propose marriage (some consider the slap as unmanly, but Yuri explains in the light novel that he only slapped Wolfram because he has a beautiful face, otherwise he would have punched him). Incensed by this insult, Wolfram challenges Yuri to a duel, which is also mistakenly accepted because of Yuri\'s unfamiliarity with Mazoku custom (he picked up the knife that fell off the table).   ~!Yuri is in fact the reincarnation of, and therefore is, Susanna Julia von Winncott, who died during the war against humans 20 years ago. The pendant Conrad gave to him belonged to her. He retains some of Susanna\'s skills, as demonstrated when Adalbert brought out his stored language memory in his soul; he begins to understand the mazoku language but because Suzanna Julia was blind he is unable to read the language, although, he can read raised letters with a finger. And sometimes when he goes into a crisis mode Julia\'s influence comes to the front of his brain and he temporarily loses eyesight.  In the last fight with Soushu, Yuri defeated him, and results on him being said  as the greatest Maoh after defeating Soushu and freeing the Original King from the dark power. Because of that, Yuri is able to travel between worlds even without the help of the Original King.!~  Throughout the series, his main goal is to create a world in which Mazoku and humans can live together in peace, something that progresses slowly but surely as the series goes on.

From the beginning, Gwendal has objections to Yuri becoming the Maoh. He is a skilled tactician and is capable of using earth magic and can cast barriers. When not otherwise busy, Gwendal indulges in his hobby of knitting and sewing but often his creatures look nothing like what they\'re supposed to (for example a bear got mistaken for a black pig or a cat that looks like a raccoon). He is adamnant that knitting helps him sharpen his concentration but actually its a stress reliever for him since childhood. He is also quite fond of cute animals or cute objects such as the dolphin keychain (Bandou-kun) Yuri received at the dolphin show and later gave to him. His childhood best friend is Anissina von Karbelnikoff, an inventor who often tests out her inventions on him, much to his displeasure. Anissina is also the one who taught Gwendal how to knit. Gwendal\'s left eye is a key to one of the four Forbidden Boxes, the ""End of the Earth"".  Gwendal is a tough guy except when it comes to his childhood friend, Anissina, and his brothers. He is afraid of Anissina and often hides from her so he can prevent being used in one of her crazy experiments. He is even seen sweating in panic at the thought of her. While he does not outwardly show much affection towards his brothers, he shows in times of great stress that he does care, an example being his decision to stand against the Original King to save his little brother, Wolfram. Jozak, who was sent to locate one of the Four Forbidden Boxes, tells Conrad that Gwendal really cares for Conrad\'s wellbeing and doesn\'t want Conrad to worry despite the Original King\'s wishes for Conrad to find the Boxes. His ancestor, Siegbert Voltaire, fought along the Original King.  When he was younger, Gwendal despised humans, a habit called the Mazoku Pride by Dunheely Weller. On Dunheely\'s last journey to a nameless village, he told Gwendal to enjoy the ride before their last duel. Upon arriving in the village, Gwendal is shocked that the village isn\'t recognized by Shin Makoku, and leads the attack on the bandits which targeted the village. In this duel, Gwendal sees Dunheely for who he really was, an old man, not the agile man he knew when he was younger. Dunheely later dies of old age, and Gwendal buries him near the tree where Dunheely told Gwendal what he was looking for. Years later while on a picnic with his family and Yuri, Gwendal admits that Dunheely was a larger existence than anyone else within him, because he hated that man.  Gwendal has no interest in love affairs, and even points out that issues coming from love affairs are beyond his abilities to influence. He does occasionally show care towards Greta, often being in charge of her while Yuri and Wolfram are in one of their adventures. Gwendal knows how to bake, as he does so for Greta when Günter, who would usually bake cookies for Greta, leaves the castle for a short journey. Greta comments that Gwendal\'s cookies look cute while Yuri comments Gwendal is good at baking as Gwendal\'s cookies are made into animal shapes, similar to the ones he knits. When Greta asks Gwendal if she is disturbing him while he is doing work, Gwendal says ""Since it\'s you, I don\'t mind"".  He is the commander of the demon army and often comes with reinforcements when Yuri finds himself in big trouble. He is also the one who does the paperwork and essentially runs the kingdom for Yuri. Often enough, when Yuri leaves the castle, Gunter is seen barging into Gwendal\'s office, demanding where Yuri is.

He is a \'bishōnen\', which means a pretty or beautiful boy. He is very feminine looking, with a beautiful face and shoulder-length and long eyelashes. His appearance is so influential, that several dying people in the hospital have a miraculous recovery after laying eyes on him. Wolfram possesses fire magic, as well as being adept with a sword. He is the half-brother of Conrad and Gwendal. He has extremely high pride and is hot-headed. He is arrogant and short-tempered but can also be quite compassionate at times. He is called ""little lord brat."" He is the only one of the previous queen\'s three sons who inherited her emerald green eyes and blonde hair, bearing a striking resemblance to her. It seems he inherited fire magic and selfishness from his fathers side. Wolfram is obsessed with Yuri and insists on following him everywhere as he claims it is his duty to protect his fiancé, though he also seems to want to prevent him from cheating on him. His ancestor, Rufus Bielefield, fought alongside the Original King (the great one).  Near the end of the second season, there is a time when Wolfram is possessed by Original King, who in turned was possessed by Soushu. The key he possesses, his heart, is ripped out by Original King in order to open one of the four boxes, \'Hellfire in Frozen Land\' (\'Hellfire on Frozen Tundra\' in Japanese translation). Because of this, Wolfram temporarily dies, but is revived when the Original King returns the keys to their owners.  Wolfram is the youngest son of the former Maoh, Cecilie von Spitzweig. He initially dislikes humans, even Conrad\'s father. Because of his mazoku pride, he does not like to admit that Conrad is his brother, even though he cares for Conrad (Wolfram always referred to Conrad by his last name - Lord Weller; however, after Conrad\'s return from his supposed betrayal, Wolfram refers to Conrad by his first name). In the graphic novels, it is hinted that this hatred towards humans stems from his late father\'s prejudice against humans. His liking for humans improves throughout the series, progressing to the point that he adopts the human girl Greta as his daughter, starts acknowledging Yuri\'s parents as his future ""in-laws"" and also runs into a raging fire to save a human child.  Years ago when he was a child, Wolfram accidentally slapped Elizabeth, Raven\'s niece, on her left cheek. Elizabeth never forgot this incident, insisting that they swore everlasting love that day, while Wolfram insists he forgot why he slapped her in the first place. Some time after collecting three of the Four Forbidden Boxes, Elizabeth becomes Stoffel\'s tool to separate Yuri from the three brothers, pronouncing an engagement proposal to Yuri. Elizabeth\'s real goal is to marry Wolfram Onii-sama, but Wolfram says that his only fiance is Yuri. During the duel which ensues, (as Yuri accidentally picked up a knife and a fork pointing it at Elizabeth; symbolizing a fight to settle a triangle love affair), Yuri turns into the Maoh, protecting Wolfram from being hurt by fire maryoku that Elizabeth summoned. He proclaims the two go on the date and remember their childhood memories. It is eventually learned that Wolfram slapped Elizabeth because he wanted to touch a butterfly that flew past, and Conrad was watching the entire event.  Wolfram is an extremely \'pretty\' person - Yuri calls him this upon first meeting him (specifically using the term \'bishōnen\' in the Japanese version and very often in the light novel). This is also why Yuri slapped Wolfram when he badmouthed Yuri\'s mother instead of punching him, stating that it\'s a pity to dirty such a pretty face (from the novels).This image is enhanced by his choice of nightwear - a frilly pink nightgown that contrasts violently with his rather quick temper.  When he first becomes engaged to Yuri he is extremely upset, but the idea quickly grows on him. He takes the engagement much more seriously than Yuri does. He follows Yuri practically everywhere so he can keep an eye on him and even sneaks into Yuri\'s bedroom at night. He gets extremely jealous when Yuri talks to a girl or good-looking guy and often accuses him of being unfaithful which is sometimes used as comic relief, but as a character he is popular between fans and is considered to be the anime\'s breakout character. Even if he does not like to admit it, the series hints that Wolfram deeply cares about Yuri. He tends to think Yuri can be saved from bad situations because of his cuteness. By the end of the anime, he is making blatant declarations of love.  A major weakness is that he gets sea-sick. Yuri also says that Wolfram cannot paint well, even though he insists on painting. For example, he tries to paint Yuri, although it turns out unintentionally impressionistic.  During the end of season two and the beginning of season three, Wolfram is chosen by the Ten Noble Families of Shin Makoku (Christ, Voltaire, Grantz, Bielefeld, Karbelnikoff, Wincott, Spitzberg, Gyllenhaal, Rochefort, and Radford) to become the next Maoh, due to the belief that Yuri would not be able to return to Shin Makoku at the time. When Yuri does in fact return, Wolfram\'s uncle, Waltorana, places pressure on Wolfram to obtain the throne. Because of this, Wolfram dissolves the engagement with Yuri and travels back to his homelands, in hopes that he would not be used to sabotage Yuri.  Discovering of Wolfram\'s predicament, Yuri and his retainers travel to the Bielefeld lands in the hopes of persuading Wolfram to return to Blood Pledge Castle, only to be forced into a formal duel by Wolfram himself. The battle becomes quite intense, as Wolfram gives his all against Yuri and Yuri trying his best to persuade Wolfram to stop the duel. At the climax, Yuri was forced to protect himself by becoming the Maoh and, angered by Wolfram\'s reckless dueling, prepares to hit Wolfram with a potentially fatal attack. In the process of hitting Wolfram with the attack, Yuri watched as Wolfram prepared himself for what seems to be his last moment and gave his final words to Yuri: ""Yuri. Be a good king."" Realizing that Wolfram had planned the whole thing from the beginning so Yuri could remain the Maoh, Yuri absorbed the attack onto himself at the last moment, sparring Wolfram of the damage. The Ten Noble Families then changed their decision to keep Yuri as their king and Waltorana steps down from forcing Wolfram onto the throne. After a reconciliation between the two, Wolfram happily decides to annul the disengagement to a comically shocked Yuri and proceeds to return to his normal attitude towards their engagement.  During the course of the series, Wolfram has grown exponentially from a spoiled prince to a selfless young man who stands by Yuri with no question. Though, he had no plans of becoming Maoh in the first place, he was willing to protect and serve Shin Makoku when it was resolved that Yuri would not be returning back at the end of the second season, wanting to protect the beautiful job Yuri did as Maoh.

Ryomou is in love with Saji and cares for Teifu (who loves her). Ryomou has always fought for the fun of it and considers herself no one\'s woman. Presumably because of her dragon she has a minor split personality; one is fairly shy and normal and the other is psychosexual. Her psycho side is not nearly as bad as Ryubi, Sousou and Hakufu. Three years prior to the start of the series Ryomou fought Ryubi when her dragon had awakened and saved her life right before Ryubi attempted to rip her own heart out. In the process Ryubi\'s dragon possessed Ryomou\'s left-eye and now perfectly coexists with her. Its power even healed her completely after being mortally wounded and stabbed through the heart by Teni. No other characters seem to be in harmony with their dragons as much as Ryomou, but she still seals it with her eye-patch and is believed to be dying because of it. Very few are aware of this, and it is not stated whether she shares Ryubi\'s dragon or now has her own. While she has it, she is as powerful as the other Three Rulers. Her magical eye may be a reference to the Chinese idiom ""To look at a person with a new eye"" or reevaluate them or not to judge them by their appearance, an idiom attributed to Lu Meng who was as brilliant a scholar as he was a warrior.\n\nAnime\nRyomou\'s anime incarnation is much more taciturn and serious than her manga self to the point of being almost unemotional. She is not shy or spoony and acts uninterested in relationships. In one scene she isn\'t even phased when Saji puts his hand down her shirt and gropes her. Her magatama is also shown as being silver in the first season, and by the second season she is arguably as strong as Myousai, though she retreats during their first battle in order to protect the Dragon Jade. She doesn\'t have a past relationship to Seito and Ryubi either. Instead her dragon appears to be her own, though how she got it is not known. She also appears to be closer to Hakufu than she does in the manga and goes out of her way to help the Nanyo leader whenever she can. She even went out on her own to find the Dragon Jade to save Hakufu. She was badly injured after being ambushed by Teni. Chou-un came to her rescue but Ryomou awakened her own dragon, defeating Teni. Chou-un was able to knock out Ryomou, bandage her and return her to Nanyo after stealing the Dragon Jade. Chou-un stated that if Ryomou was not injured during the awakening of her dragon, Ryomou would have been able to defeat her. Ryomou recovered to full strength and played a part in the Battle of Chibi, defeating Myosai. She is now working along with Hakufu in a cosplay cafe, dressed as a cat maid (Ryomou even wears a heart-shaped eye-patch).\n\n(Source: [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/character/3548/Shimei_Ryomou))', 'gender': 'Female', 'modNotes': None}]}}"

It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo\'s spiritual power, which he didn\'t know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form.

Uryuu Ishida is a dark blue-haired, bespectacled teenager of average height. At school, Uryuu wears the school uniform along with a tie, while outside he dons white Quincy clothes with blue stripes representing the Quincy cross, and a mantle.  Uryuu is generally shy and quiet, but tries harder to act cool when other people are around. For example, during the Soul Society arc he wears a mantle that serves no purpose other than to make him look cooler, despite the fact that it hinders his movement. He even keeps a spare to that effect. In addition, he also has a tendency to say things with characteristic drama. Uryuu operates on a moral ethic known as the ""Pride of the Quincy"" and has a strong sense of justice. He has also shown to be very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly. He demonstrates this at multiple points throughout the series, such as when he tried to defend Rukia Kuchiki from Renji Abarai when he and Byakuya Kuchiki came to the real world to take her, or when he defends Orihime Inoue at multiple points throughout the Soul Society arc. Uryuu also has a tendency to not use lethal force in battle, especially if he can win without doing so. Instead, he will simply incapacitate his opponent.  Uryuu does not hold his father, Ryuuken Ishida, in high respect; he calls his father by his given name which is considered very rude in Japanese society. Despite this, in the anime Uryuu seems mildly offended when Rukia commented that the Ishida\'s hospital (his father being the present director) is falling apart and Renji replies tactlessly that the hospital is only for show.  Uryuu has low blood pressure and hates procrastination. The other things he hates are quite odd: buttons (despite being an expert in sewing) and the word ""haphazard.""

In the series, he is usually seen wearing either his school uniform or a t-shirt. At one point in the series, he is seen wearing a dark, long-sleeved shirt with a rose emblazoned on the left sleeve. The rose may be in honor of his grandfather seeing as how his grandfather\'s name was Oscar Joaquín de la Rosa, de la Rosa being Spanish for ""of the Rose.""  Chad is a quiet person and is sometimes the subject of jokes or bullies because he never fights back, against ordinary humans, or often hollows and Soul Reapers until necessary. Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. To match his extraordinary size, Chad possesses extraordinary superhuman durability, even before activating his spiritual powers, being able to survive the impact of a falling steel girder on his back and a head-on motorcycle collision, and is strong enough to break telephone poles and wield them as giant clubs, even when already injured. Besides his physical strength, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 10th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo ranked 23rd.  Chad likes music, but rarely watches TV. The only programs he likes are Carnivore Kingdom, which starts at 8 a.m. on Sundays. He likes it so much that he bought the DVDs for it. Not surprisingly, since Kon is a cheap knock-off plushie of the main character of Carnivore Kingdom, Chad finds Kon especially cute. The other show is Don Kan\'onji\'s Ghost Bust.

At one point, the schoolgirls ask [Rukia](https://anilist.co/character/6/Rukia-Kuchiki) if she has feelings for Ichigo. When Rukia denies any such thing, Orihime is disappointed that Rukia does not share her sentiments, because if she had, then it would be two girls against one boy and therefore the girls ""team"" would win, which makes no sense. She also tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as portraying herself as a futuristic and apparently highly destructive robot in an assignment asking ""How do you see yourself in the future?"", when the question refers to what occupation one wishes or believes they will have. Orihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki. She is in love with Ichigo, and in both the manga and anime, her feelings only become more evident as time goes on. She has revealed these feelings both to Rangiku Matsumoto and to Ichigo himself, though he was asleep at the time. She also has the uncanny ability to detect Ichigo by scent and sense his spiritual pressure, even when masked by the visored.  \n\nOrihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by relatives living elsewhere. Previously, she had lived with her older brother, [Sora](https://anilist.co/character/27739/Sora-Inoue), who was fifteen years older than her.

For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic.

While they initially opted against becoming shinigami, the death of all their friends prompted Rukia to suggest joining the academy for a better life.  At the shinigami academy, Renji was admitted into the top class and Rukia into the second ranked one. Renji and Rukia started growing further apart as Renji got further ahead in his training.

Unknown to Rukia, [Byakuya](https://anilist.co/character/907/Byakuya-Kuchiki) had adopted her in order to fulfill the last wish of Hisana, whom he had taken as his wife. \n\nIn the 13th Division, Rukia was not given a seat position, due to Byakuya Kuchiki\'s influence, since he did not want her sent on dangerous missions. She became friends with the division lieutenant, [Kaien Shiba](https://anilist.co/character/1893/Kaien-Shiba), who trained and mentored her. Their first training location was Mount Koifushi of Hokutan, the 3rd district of West Rukongai.  Rukia greatly admired Kaien\'s wife, 3rd Seat [Miyako Shiba](https://anilist.co/character/22895/Miyako-Shiba). When Miyako was killed by a hollow, Rukia, Kaien, and the division\'s captain, [Jūshirō Ukitake](https://anilist.co/character/2682/Juushirou-Ukitake) hunted the hollow down. Kaien faced the hollow alone but the hollow\'s special ability destroyed his zanpakutō. Rukia attempted to draw her sword and help but was stopped by Ukitake. He told her that Kaien\'s fight was one of honor rather than a fight for his life. If Rukia helped, Kaien would be saved but his honor would be damaged forever. Meanwhile, the hollow entered Kaien and possessed him. Ukitake faced the hollow but his illness allowed the hollow the opportunity to attack Rukia. Kaien momentarily regained control and thrust himself through Rukia\'s zanpakutō. He thanked Rukia and Ukitake for letting him fight for his honor and died in Rukia\'s arms. Rukia brought the corpse to the Shiba family but was afraid to apologize since she felt guilty about her role in Kaien\'s death.

So because of his abundance of money and free time, using his Techode Thunderbolt, he goes out and attempts to solve crimes and punish evil-doers, because he wants to do something good, as he feels the local police force is very lacking. Takumi is also noted to have a very short temper and constantly takes out his anger on people, usually ending up in him getting in wide variety of trouble. Takumi\'s main adversary in the series is Katana who is essentially his polar opposite, using his Techode to commit crimes and not caring about others at all along with several polarities in appearance, personality and back story. Takumi refers to Katana as evil and is more obsessed with Katana than Katana is with Hajiki. Time and again, Takumi claims that Katana is a beast, raised in violence, and for that reason, violence is all he knows, saying that he cannot be made friends with and he is not a real person at all. Despite all of Takumi\'s loathing, Katana sees him only as a pest that he\'s done nothing to provoke and on more than one occasion beats Takumi severely. Later in the series it becomes apparent that Takumi\'s constant ranting about Katana being violent and vicious is actually Takumi casting his own control issues on Katana because it\'s easier for the ""bad guy"" to be the one with problems, as ""heroes"" are good and just and can never be wrong. It is Hajiki that tells Takumi he could never truly understand how hard it is to live without money, as his parents left him enough so that he would never have to ""waste his life"" in a job. Unlike Hajiki, who works for a living, and Katana, who steals and is a mercenary for a living, Takumi is ""too busy being high and mighty and righteous"" to see that the world isn\'t black and white. Takumi later admits to himself that he has no idea what he was talking about and didn\'t know anything about the people he was fighting or who he was protecting.

Lumière is a GOTT receptionist and ES member like her partner Éclair. Lumière has little to no physical abilities. She instead makes up for this with her adept, controlled mind, her wit and her ability to control any computer unit. Even though she is younger than Éclair she is far more mature, from the way she dresses, from her politeness, to her tastes (she likes the opera and fine wine). She is always trying to convince Éclair to be more lady-like through her catch-phrase, ""A Lady should really be more elegant."" Lumiere also possesses a friendship with the AI unit of the La Muse, Wirbelwind, which she created. Her computer abilities do not manifest in the typing sense, as long as she touch an electric circuit she can bring it under control just using her mind. She doesn\'t even need to touch an object to interact with it, as her ""Puppet"" ability allows her to extend ""strings"" of nanites towards the object, allowing her to link with it from a distance. She also manifests herself into the digital space and can also spawn Mini-Lumière\'s to assist her in data collection tasks and the such. Her skills are so impressive that she can break through 3,786 firewalls in less than ten minutes, or can even bring a planet\'s environment under her control. While on the run with Éclair, she was even able to defeat the D-Command (an electronic warfare program designed to incapacitate rouge ES agents) by hacking her own nanites so as to develop an immunity.\n\nLumière is often the person who sits at the side during missions, she spends a lot more bonding time with Armbrust than Éclair. She is also far more intelligent than Éclair and on numerous occasions, things that are obvious to Lumière and the audience are not obvious to Éclair, but she has more than one experiences when her life was in major danger because she has no physical ability.

She does this with the assistance of her younger partner and fellow receptionist Lumière, her Guard robot Donnerschlag and the space-ship La Muse. She is 165cm tall, her three sizes (in cm) are 90-54-85, her favorite foods are celery and carrots, and her favorite phrase is ""Que será, será.""\n\nKnown for her childish nature, she often dresses up in either a skimpy or amusing, but loosely related to the situation, costume. For instance when she was sent to take a letter of attorney to the Faunusian government, she dressed up in a pizza delivery outfit, and placed the letter in a pizza box. She also has a tendency to shout ""Ta-da!"" (じゃっじゃ～ん！) whenever she arrives on the scene to arrest someone or instances when she surprises or saves Lumière. Her rash nature also often makes her overreact to situations, for instance, in one instance she could not get official arrest authorization and jumped off and pursued to destroy many robots. This lack of composure often makes Lumière say, ""A Lady should be more elegant,"" also later Mrs. Padushka also states ""You\'re so rash, how will you ever find a husband?"" Despite this she is naturally honest and direct, and tries to remain cheerful even when on assignment. Although she is hot-headed and immature, Éclair is also very sweet and caring and willing to help others, whether it be friend or stranger. This gentle tendency has got her and Lumière pursued by GOTT because she defied her orders by helping the civilians when on an enforcement mission to support the dictator.\n\nÉclair possesses great physical strength which borders on the ridiculous, and also uses her lipstick whip often in battle. Her lipstick deserves note, if she draws with it on a surface, the drawn lipstick is actually so tough and rubbery that she can lift it of the surface and use it as a whip, or in one instance to make two ropes to stop of mob of people opposing the Nouvlesse. Her lipstick serves another purpose, as she uses self-hypnotic suggestion so that she can only really use her immense strength when she wears lipstick. In at least one extreme circumstance, she substituted some of her own blood from an injury for the lipstick to achieve the same effect. Éclair is at first believed to be part cyborg, her enhancements letting her move so fast as to appear to teleport from place to place. The nature of these enhancements are not explained at first and are typically attributed to her ES ability: ""Power."" ""Power"" also enables her to heal rapidly from most types of wounds, so she\'s sometimes known as ""The ES Agent who cannot die."" Later in the series, she reveals the true extent of her ""Power,"" which are actually G-Class, which allow her to hover, and create spheres or waves of concussive forces, as well as shielding.

In reality, she is the daughter of Li Jiang Qiang, the leader of the crime syndicate Zheng Dao Hui. However at the age of two, she and her mother were involved in a car accident when their car plunged off a cliff into a river. Her mother was killed in the accident but Xiang Ying was never found, despite the best efforts of her father and his organization to locate her. In a cruel twist of fate, Xiang Ying was found and taken in by the Zhuque Corps (a section of Zheng Dao Hui which specializes in assassinations) and trained to be an assassin. Because of the accident, she has no memory of her childhood, and as a result does not know her true parentage. This is also why her entry in the Zhuque was never known by her father until it was too late. While in training for the Zhuque Corps, she was referred to as Number 27 but after her training was complete, she was referred to as Glass Heart. After attempting to commit suicide, the heart of Kaori Makimura was transplanted into her, and with it, the overpowering desire to live and to be reunited with Ryo Saeba. As a result, she busts out of the lab she was kept in and travels to Japan where she finally meets Ryo. Ryo, in turn adopts Xiang Ying as their (Ryo and Kaori&#039;s) daughter.      Xiang Ying was only 15 years old at the start of the series, despite looking like she was in her early twenties. By volume 20 of the manga she is already 19 years old, though appearance-wise she has not changed.      Xiang Ying has had very little contact with the outside world, except through her handlers. As a result, any potential situation which she perceives as a threat assessment would meet a harsh response, as evidenced when she nearly kills a man merely trying to pick her up. Not surprisingly, the people around her, Ryo, Saeko, Umibozu, Chin, and even Xin Hong realize they have an upward task in trying to teach her how to function in the outside world.      There are several coincidences between Xiang Ying and Kaori. One, is that the Japanese character for Kaori is pronounced as &quot;Xiang&quot; in Chinese, hence her name &quot;Xiang Ying&quot;. Also, her major histocompatibility complex is very similar to Kaori&#039;s as their human leukocyte antigen encodings are virtually identical. Because of this, Xiang Ying does not need to worry about her body rejecting Kaori&#039;s heart as her immune system has been fooled into thinking her heart is the same.      With Kaori&#039;s heart, she remembers all of Kaori&#039;s memories, her residence, favorite coffee, quotes, and emotions. Along with these memories she inherits is also the ability to hammer Ryo with Hammerspace weapons if Ryo gets out of line (much like Kaori did), much to Ryo&#039;s annoyance.

Only a few people in the anime have called him by his real name such as his parents or DJ Blader in a few episodes. Kenny also had a crush on Ming-Ming in G-Revolution.  Kenny takes care of beyblade upgrades and repairs for the team. He usually doesn\'t take part in Beybattles for the team, but has a beyblade that hops when he does.

In the English dub of the first two seasons of the anime, Kenny\'s laptop has a female bit-beast inside, called Dizzi who was added to the show in placement of Kenny\'s normal laptop screen. Because Kenny did not use his laptop much in the 3rd season, the addition of Dizzi to the show was impossible to keep up and she was taken out.

In fact, many comparatives can be made between his personality and Yin and Yang, which he appropriately wears the symbol of, the Taijitu. The forces of Yin and Yang are generally described as opposite but complementary forces, and the same can be said about him. He can be calm and collected, but also a fierce competitor. These two qualities can be referred to as opposites, but they are not absolute in their differences, and the same can be said about Yin and Yang. Furthermore, the forces of Yin and Yang are interdependent, meaning that they cannot exist without their counterpart. This can also be compared to Ray's personality. His whole nature seems to be similar in principal to this metaphysical concept.  (Season One) Ray is first introduced to the show in episode 6, named Dragoon Storm. In this episode, he is portrayed as a powerful and confident competitor. However, some may say that he is shown as overconfident in some aspects, especially before the battle against Tyson had even begun. In the first battle, Ray easily, and almost effortlessly destroys Tyson's blade using his bit beast Driger's Tiger Claw attack. The following battle, Ray becomes somewhat cocky about his ability, and ends up losing the 2nd round to Tyson. Ray forfeits the final, deciding battle, saying that he had no more to prove. After the final round of the Tournament, between Tyson and Kai, Ray approaches Tyson, along with Max and Mr. Dickenson, inviting him and Kai to join the new BBA team called the Blade Breakers.  Throughout the first season, Ray is looked to for advice about battles. He is generally revered as a kind hearted, polite individual, who is very welcoming when meeting new people. He is also shown as being very open minded, especially about Beyblading techniques. This is emphasised in the Asian tournament, used as a means to justify his leaving of his home village. It is also shown in this season that he has an uncle who is the head chef at a restaurant in Paris, which is owned by Olivers' Dad. It is also shown that he works as a waiter in a restaurant in Hong Kong for extra cash. This has led to an opinion of him loving to cook.  (Season Two) Generally, Ray is shown in a similar light as to how he is portrayed in season 1, although in V-Force, he is much more critical of his performance.  A good example of Ray's kind hearted nature is shown in V-Force, in the battle against Salima and Cyber Driger. During this battle, Salima becomes somewhat hypocritical towards her original philosophies towards beyblading. Because of this, Ray spends most of the battle trying to convince her that using Cyber Driger has tainted her beliefs.  Ray uses three beyblades in the second season--Driger Fang, Driger Vulcan, and Driger Vulcan 2.  (Season Three) In this series, Ray is portrayed in a very different way from the other two series. In the previous two, he was shown as being a polite young man, but unconfident in his beyblading ability. In G-Revolution however, he is shown as being confident, almost to the point of being cocky. It is this that causes him to lose some of his matches. During this series, he leaves the Bladebreakers to help form the White Tigers X team, partnering up with his former teammate, Lee.  Ray uses three beyblades in this season, the Driger Vulcan 2,the Driger Gatling, and Driger Metal Slash.

She also has dark brown pupils and a fair complexion. Because of the effects of being a Flame Haze, Shana\'s body age remains to that of a girl of 13 to 14 years old. Upon invoking her powers as a Flame Haze, her hair and eyes change color to a fiery crimson, with embers fluttering from her head down.  In her first few years as a Flame Haze, she wears an all-black attire consisting of a shirt, pants and her Treasure Tool Yogasa in the form of a trench coat. However, after she decided to stay in Misaki City, she is most usually seen with the Misaki City Municipal High School uniform and when in combat, has the Yogasa as a cape worn over her clothes.  She is later seen wearing a red-and-black frilly dress on her stay inside the Seireiden. <br><br>\n\nInitially, she is concentrated solely on her duty as a Flame Haze, not even considering getting a name as she didn\'t see any importance having it. She sees Yuji only as a Torch, an object, albeit marginally interesting because of his status as a Mystes. However, she slowly opens up to Yuji, coming to think of him as a person despite being a Torch, and eventually comes to show affection to him. Her duty made her indifferent towards human life at first, but through Yuji\'s influence, Shana has opened up slightly, although she still remains confused and disgruntled by some human traits which she considers as pointless, although some of it is used to mask her jealousy of her desired monopoly on Yuji. <br><br>\n\nShana has a habit of saying ""Urusai! Urusai! Urusai!"" (""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"") whenever Yuji asks her questions or makes remarks that disturb her original worldview or embarrass her. But in reality they really care for each other. She has a great fondness for anything sweet, eventually putting melon bread above her preference.  Shana is shown to be highly intelligent as she has gotten a perfect score on every exam and is talented in Physical Education. She is shown, however, to be naive when it comes to social affairs, once even unabashfully asking ""how babies are made"" to Chigusa. <br><br>\n\nKnown only as the ""Flaming-Haired, Blazing-Eyed Hunter,"" Shana bears no name until she meets Yuji, who names her after the sword she wields. As a ""Flame Haze,"" Shana is sworn to protect the balance of the world by hunting down the ""Guze no Tomogara;"" monsters from the ""Crimson Realm"" who come to earth in order to harvest the ""Power of Existence"" from its denizens. Together with Alastor, ""Flame of the Heavens"" and Shana\'s guide who lives within her, and speaks to her through a necklace she wears, she has become one of the most powerful Flame Haze in existence. <br><br>\n\nShana is said to be the most powerful, known and feared by most Crimson Denizens with her title alone. This has allowed her to defeat many powerful Denizens, and permits her many different abilities, including her proficiency with the Nietono no Shana, the ability to wield flames, manipulate the Power of Existence, harbor extrasensory traits, and fly with wings of flame. In the third volume of the manga, the first volume of the novel, and the movie, Alastor states that the reason why she did not explode after being shot by Friagne\'s Trigger Happy was because she held a capacity that existed in dimensional space, who was able to contain the Flame of Heaven\'s (and more); He has thus stated her as ""The Great One"". <br><br>\n\n~!Unrestricted Spells  Wings of Crimson (紅蓮の双翼 Guren no Souyoku?) - a pair of fiery wings appear on her back, allowing flight. At first, Shana is not able to use this spell without Yuji in range;later on, she manages to use Guren no Souyoku when she fought in later battles. These wings were fast enough to evade Hecate\'s powerful Aster spell. Great   Blade of Crimson (紅蓮の大太刀 Guren no Oodachi?) - coats Shana\'s sword with a flame which she can use to hurl at enemies from a distance.  Heaven-and-Earth Sundering (天破壌砕 Tenpa Jousai?) - an Unrestricted Spell inherited by Flame Haze of the title ""Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter"". Using up an enormous amount of Power of Existence, Alastor materializes in the living world, causing widespread damage in a large area. Flame Haze who use this spell usually loses all of their Power of Existence as requirement of the spell and dies; Shana manages to survive using this spell because of the amount of Power of Existence she can carry, unlike her predecessor Mathilde Saint-Omer. In the novel, she doesn\'t use this spell yet since the anime\'s finale was originally written. !~  However, she demonstrates a clear lack of experience in battle, as noted by Sophie Sawallisch, who has witnessed her fighting style first-hand.This is once responsible for her defeat against Flame Haze Margery Daw, who is a specialist in Power of Unrestraint.\n\n~!She was rescued and picked up by Wilhelmina Carmel and Shiro when she was an infant. She was then raised and trained in Tendoukyuu. Alastor stated that she is ""The Great One"", destined to be a very majestic figure when she grows up (if she didn\'t get involved with Crimson Realm beforehand). After the destruction of the Tendoukyuu, she and Wilhelmina went their separate ways in Hong Kong, with the latter\'s intentions of allowing her to learn on her own as a Flame Haze.  The new ""Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter"" proceeds to her solitary journey, eventually becoming a companion of Sophie Sawallisch, a veteran Flame Haze, in Eastern Europe. Sophie notices her crudeness in combat and lack of femininity and decides to train her, while teaching her the ways of being a lady. The Flame Haze later travels to Japan, where she is involved with affairs relating to a certain Denizen which dwells in Yosegi City before reaching Misaki City. She later meets Yuji by chance in one attack initiated by Friagne, the Crimson Lord who was staying at that city. !~\n\nDespite being the title character of the anime, Shana has few character relations with many of the characters in the show. That would be because of the manner she was raised. Wilhelmina, Shiro and Alastor mostly focused on her physical and mental being, forgetting that being as socially adept is as important. This was, as Alastor said, one of their mistakes, since they thought that they would just teach her these feelings when she grows up a little more, not realizing that these feelings should be developed, and could not be taught so hastily. (Although, Shiro did teach her indirectly that love is the most powerful unrestricted spell of all.)  Her main social interest is Yuji, whom she sees as her love interest. Her relationship with Yuji is one of the driving forces of the series. Shana takes orders and advice from the Crimson Lord she is bound to, Alastor, and has a mentor and guardian in the form of Wilhelmina Carmel. Kazumi Yoshida is her love-rival for Yuji, and Shana treats her with contempt and disdain. She generally treats most other characters with ignorance and indifference, with the exception of Chigusa Sakai, who she looks to as a source in answering certain difficulties when Alastor or Wilhelmina are unable to do so. Shana eventually starts to be more open to the other characters, especially in regards to her relationship with Kazumi becoming more friendly. <br><br>\n\nAfter meeting Yuji, Shana goes through a chaotic phase in she experiences new emotions like love, jealousy, hatred, and loneliness. This leads her to making rash decisions in battle as she\'s unable to identify or deal with what she\'s feeling. When Shana finally realizes that having Yuji with her in battle helps her fight better, she begins to unlock new abilities and becomes more proficient in battle. <br><br>', 'gender': 'Female', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Kazumi'}, 'description': '__Height:__ 160cm (5\'2"")\n\nYuji\'s classmate. She has a crush on him, but is too shy to tell him directly. However, she grows more confident and decidedly more direct in her advance after seeing Shana\'s feelings. She proclaims that she will confess, sparking a rivalry between Shana and her.    \n\n~!Pheles gives Kazumi a cross shaped hougu in the second season. The hougo would summon Pheles if there was any trouble happening to Yuji/Johan. If she used it, however, it would take all her powers of existence. She was later taken to Seireiden by Yuji to be used as a catalyst to the ritual reversing the effects of Khamsin\'s Tuning. After Shana, Wilhelmina, Chiara, Sale and the three remaining members of The Four Gods of Earth reached Seireiden, Shana witnesses Kazumi understanding what she needed to do at that time and activates Giralda, her existence disappearing.!~  ', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Yuuji'}, 'description': '__Height:__ 165cm (5\'4"")\n__Classification:__ Mystes  \n\n~!Crimson Lord, Flame Haze, Human Title: Silver the Second Contracted to: Snake of the Festival!~\n\nYuuji, the main character of the story, is just an average high school student. However, his world is turned upside down when he discovers that he is already dead and does not have much time before he disappears. Fortunately, Yuuji is a Mystes who contains a treasure known as the Reiji Maigo. The treasure inside him restores his Power of Existence every night at midnight. With the Reiji Maigo, Yuuji has the possibility to live on like an average human as long as he makes sure that his Power of Existence does not run out before midnight. Later, he begins to learn to use the yet untapped potential of the treasure kept within him. He cares deeply about Shana, but does not make any advances in their relationship due to his feelings of depreciation as a Torch and viewing Shana as someone who is beyond his reach. He also starts to see Shana from her old former perspective of the world, where he is just a Torch and she is just a Flame Haze. \n\nWith this going on, he distanced himself from the closeness that the two originally shared previously. Yuuji is kind person who puts others before himself. This often draws much confusion and annoyance from Shana, as prior torches from Shana\'s experience exhibited selfish attitudes. However, Yuuji\'s compassion and empathy sow the seeds of attraction between him and Shana. He accepts his fate with no ill feelings, a trait which surprised the Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter, knowing that most Torches would be depressed to the point that they would even commit suicide before their existence wears off. In fact, Yuji uses this fate to commit acts of heroism, defended by the belief that even if his existence would one day disappear, his sacrifice would be proof that he had once lived.  Despite all these changes, he still struggles to live the ordinary life he once had and at the same time, trying to help Shana in her battles and save Misaki City and its inhabitants.   ~! Shana and Kazumi, who both harboured feelings for Yuji, both decided to write him a letter, and whomever he would respond to would be the one he had chosen. Unfortunately, he had disappeared on Christmas Eve, and everyone except those who had knowledge of who he really is, had forgotten about him. It is later revealed that Yuji chose Shana over Kazumi. He was even surprised that his feelings were already there for a long time and contemplated about all the time wasted with her. With this realization, he made a decision and voluntarily erased his existence on Christmas Eve, for the sake of changing Shana\'s fate.  Meanwhile, he also received advice from a mysterious voice which offered him the chance of saving Shana from the endless conflict between Flame Haze and the Crimson Realm. Yuji accepts this offer and merges with the owner of the voice; none other than the Crimson God, ""Snake of the Festival"".Employing his new powers which even exceed that of a Crimson Lord, Yuji joins Bal Masqué, where the Priestess (Hecate), the Strategist (Bel Peol) and Fecor (Bel Peol\'s right-hand man) accept him as the new leader. After, he goes to Misaki City and faces off with Shana, defeating her, and proceeds to the Yoda Department Store, where Eita and Kazumi are, to claim the Haridan which belongs to Bal Masque. Kazumi asks why he returned the letters she wrote to him and Yuji replies that he cannot think of anything to say to her that won\'t hurt her feelings (meaning Yuji returned Kazumi\'s letters instead of bluntly rejecting her, thinking that his actions would be less hurtful than saying it openly. This indicates that he has chosen Shana over her.).\n\nAfter encountering and defeating Shana in Misaki City, Yuji restrains her powers using the Tartaros and takes her away to the Seireiden. He and a few member of Bal Masqué then travel to the rift between the human world and the Crimson Realm, the place where the body of the Snake of the Festival is sealed.  Bal Masque successfully awakens the Snake of the Festival\'s true form, which brings forth an advantage in the war against the Flame Haze. The Snake\'s true form is successfully brought upon the Earth which gives enough of a morale boost to Bal Masque\'s troops that the Flame Haze begin losing the war. Yuji Sakai announced his plan to the retreating Flame Hazes that as the God of Desire, he wishes to create a new world, one that fulfils every Denizen\'s wishes that there is no war, an abundance of Power of Existence, and no pain and suffering like this world, named Xanadu. Furthermore, he added that Flame Haze should not oppose this as this also indirectly fufils Flame Hazes purpose that no more Denizens would kill humans indiscriminately for Power of Existence. However, the announcement has a darker purpose. Most of the Flame Haze made pacts with Crimson Lords for revenge, injustice, and suffering. Now with the weight of protecting a new world being irrelevant to them, is too cruel, most mentally broke down, leading to a massacre by Bal Masque\'s troops. After the war, he reveals the location that is appropriate for the creation of Xanadu, Misaki City. However, Johann was awakened by Pheles after Kazumi summoned her to the battlefield because of Sydonay weapon almost killed her when he used it strengthen the tower before Khamsin destroys it. He take out the Reiji Maigo from Yuji but Yuji won\'t allow him take it away from him. Yuji asked him the reason and intention of him taking away the Reiji Maigo. He immediately answered that he doesn\'t agree with Yuji\'s plan after Xanadu is created and after the God of Creation is separated from him. He also noted that Yuji had belittles love. He said that Yuji had underestimated Shana\'s feelings for him. He pointed out that Yuji thinks that Yuji himself is the only one who could sacrifice the world for love, when in fact, he himself had done the same thing. \n\nWhen Pheles asked him to leave the battlefield, he immediately released the Reiji Maigo and hugs Pheles. Later, Johann and Pheles cast a spell to summon a van which appears to be Gyuuki in a form of a van to take Yoshida and the two of them away. Through various battles and tactical planning, he successfully created Xanadu by sacrificing Priestess as the beginning of the creation of the new world. However, Shana and her team returns to fight Yuji Sakai as they realize the mirrored world would cause imbalance of Power of Existence in the far distant future if Denizens consumes Power of Existence recklessly. Through ensuing battles, Shana and Margery Daw successfully reconstructed the Restriction Spell to include a Law that humans can never be consumed in Xanadu. This is a last ditch effort as Shana\'s team is too small to prevent the creation of Xanadu, so they merely wanted to protect the Xanadu humans instead. As they feel relieved that their plan worked, Shana is agitated to see Yuji Sakai smiling. Yuji Sakai, foreseeing this plan reveals that the whole Restriction Spell is a secondary effect. In reality, the only requirement is to wait till midnight so that Reiji Maigo will refill, during which time he asks the Professor to place a special Restriction Spell to obtain extremely vast amount of Power of Existence under his control, where he can direct it to the creation of Xanadu and null the Law placed by Shana. Shana and the other Flame Haze have not been beaten, but have clearly lost and can only watch helplessly on at the creation of Xanadu. However Yuji Sakai, as the Snake of the Festival, hears the Denizen\'s, as well as the Flame Haze\'s, wish and does not undo the law put in place by Shana.  As the Denizens leave to Xanadu, Sakai Yuji parted with Snake of the Festival. The Strategist, holding the essence of God of Desire gave him a chain-shape key to Tartaros. At the end, the God of Desire stated he grew fond of Sakai Yuji, a mere torch that was willing to allow himself to be used as a tool to fulfil his plan, and even if nobody else approved of his plan, the God of Desire approved it and gives his blessings to Sakai Yuji, as they departed to Xanadu. Later the Spiral Organ appeared, gave Yuji a crystal containing Unrestricted Spell for bringing back the lost things, grant basic protection for his body and embedding a new unrestricted spell into the anti-flame ring Azure, saying it\'s been wonderful working with Sakai Yuji. Later, Lamies left a last parting gift, naming Yuji\'s new Unrestricted Spell, Grammatica and ask him to contemplate on the meaning of it.  \n\nNow, fully himself, he decided to face Shana and Margery Daw in the final battle, and Sydonay impressed by the boy\'s action decided to ally with him and fights Margery Daw. During the battle Sakai Yuji activated the green crystal and cast it on Yoshida Kazumi, with the last plea for her to agree. The spell activates and it restored all the destruction caused at Misaki City and healed damaged people although he regretted that dead people cannot be revived.  Shana asked Sakai Yuji what is his intention and he replied that in order to atone the killing of Flame Hazes and Humans on his quest, he will travel to Xanadu that has no Misaki City alone to teach Denizens and humans to coexist peacefully, even if it takes thousands of years so that he can finally be together with Shana without guilt. Shana punches Yuji and gives him Hirai\'s Torch.` Shana and Alastor was furious with his philosophy of severe self-punishment. They used their tremendous strength to overpowered Sakai Yuji and leads to his defeat. In the limbo, Johann confronts him smiling and teases Sakai Yuji that he underestimated the power of love again. He awakens, carried by Shana shyly said he just need to ask and she would go with him to Xanadu together without a thought. Admitting his loss he replied to Shana, he ask for her forgiveness, ask her to be with him in Xanadu and she accepts happily. As they embraced and kissed, the Spiral Organ Unrestricted Spell activated and Sakai Yuji becomes a ""solid existence"", as prophesised by God of Punishment - something more than a normal torch or a Mystes. As Yuji Sakai and Shana delights at this revelation, they departed to Xanadu. !~  ', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}]}}"

Saber refuses as the Holy Grail is just in front of her. Saber destroyed the Holy Grail in the fourth Holy Grail War because Kiritsugu used multiple command seals in order to force her to act against her will.

He is a serious yet helpful, hardworking, and honest teenager. His hobbies include fixing a variety of broken things, from VCRs to stoves, as well as cooking and cleaning. He is initially confused about the Holy Grail War and attempts to irrationally shield others from danger, including his own Servant, Saber.\n\n ~! At a later date it is revealed that Shirou has a very unique and personal mastery of magic, which his mentor Rin Tosaka identified as Projection magecraft. Shirou\'s personal Projection magecraft can also be called ""Tracing"" due to the aria he utilizes to activate the necessary processes consisting of the words ""Trace On"" and to also differentiate it from commonplace Projection magecraft. While Projection only is able to project an image in the mind of a user and has an innate limited timespan of existence, Shirou\'s Tracing is able to materialize the image, restore its personal properties and history as well, while also lacking the innate limited timespan for his replications. He may also receive temporary stat boosts (e.g. strength) and knowledge to use the projected weapon as well as to utilize the weapon\'s unique abilities (Example: Kanshou and Bakuya\'s attraction to one another). One downside though is that the weapons are of slightly lesser quality (They are downgraded one rank from the original). This penalty increases in severity the further the replicated weapon deviates from the image of a sword. He can copy techniques (e.g.: Nine Lives) as well though it is presumed they also suffer from a decrease in quality, even before accounting for the limitations of Shirou\'s biological disposition as a human.!~\n\n~!Despite possessing a great innate talent for Projection (Due to his Origin being that of ""Sword"" as well as Avalon having changed his innate elemental affinity to that of ""Sword"" as well), Kiritsugu did not teach him, refusing to allow Shirou to tread into the world of magecraft and taught Shirou that Projection magecraft was one of the weakest and most wasteful of its kind, which, while generally true, did not apply to Shirou\'s personal ability. As such, Shirou spent most of his life wrongly training in magecraft and letting some of his magic circuits grow dormant. During the events of Fate, Shirou only realizes the most basic vestiges of his ability, enabling him to trace only some items he has an exceptional familiarity to. During the events of UBW, Shirou mostly learned projection by himself and through watching Archer, his future self, allowing him to obtain Archer\'s knowledge and experiences and side stepping the need for excessive life long training. In Heaven\'s Feel, Shirou relies on Archer\'s shrouded arm to perform Projection magecraft, greatly increasing his proficiency and strength of Tracing at the cost of being unable to handle the flow of information and knowledge eroding his own self and limiting its usage to a select few times.!~\n \n~!At the culmination of his abilities is his Reality Marble, Unlimited Blade Works, which is the source of his unusual projection magic. Within Unlimited Blade Works exist all of the materials Shirou needs to recreate any weapon given the specifications mentioned before. He can\'t recreate divine constructs, as they either result in his death even in the event of a success (Excalibur - A sword shaped divine construct) or he is unable to grasp the Divine Construct\'s structure to begin with (Eg - A weapon whose structure is beyond the scope of Shirou\'s ability to comprehend). The only exception is considered Avalon during the events of Fate, which can be explained by him carrying Avalon since his childhood and his bond to Saber, which also enabled him to project Caliburn. It\'s shown as a wasteland of swords but lacking the oppressive presence of large iron gears and smog like in Archer\'s version, reflecting Shirous psyche. He is able to control all of the swords in Unlimited Blade Works using only his mind, proven to be useful in his battle against Gilgamesh where he used his blades to counter Gilgamesh\' Gate of Babylon.!~ \n\n(Source: Wikipedia & VN)', 'gender': 'Male', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Archer'}, 'description': '__Height__: 187cm (6\'1)\n__Weight__: 78kg (172 lb) \n__Hair color__: White\n__Eye color__: Gray\n\n__In Fate/stay night UBW:__  \n~!He is the Servant of one of the series\' main heroines, Rin Tousaka.

Her name, \'Nana\', is Japanese for the number seven, the number by which she was called at the research facility (""Nana"" is also a fairly common female name in Japan). Most diclonius babies are euthanized at birth in sweeps of hospital maternity wards, but Nana was one of a handful kept alive for use as a test subjects; as a result she has spent her entire life in the diclonius research facility. Kurama sees her as his daughter and cares very much for her. In an attempt to recapture Lucy, Kurama sent out Nana to find her (diclonii can telepathically sense each other), then retreat until Kurama could arrive with soldiers, but Nana wanted to impress Kurama so she tried to capture Lucy herself. Lucy and Nana engaged in a brutal telekinetic battle that ended with Lucy tearing all of Nana\'s limbs off. Kurama personally came to stop Lucy and save Nana, then also disregarded Director General Kakuzawa\'s order to kill her by giving her new prosthetic limbs and setting her free with a lot of money. Unlike many other Diclonius, because Kurama treated her with kindness, she is not homicidal or sadistic. She has the ability to temporarily disable other Diclonius\' vectors by having her vectors go through their pineal gland. Although her vector power is slightly superior to Lucy\'s in terms of range (3 meters to Lucy\'s 2)and certain abilities, she lacks Lucy\'s sheer strength (Lucy can lift and throw many more heavy objects than Nana can), and violent nature: Nana\'s empathy for others does not allow her to fight as vigorously, and she loses her arms and legs when she is viciously dismembered by Lucy. With her vector arms, she is later able to manipulate prosthetic appendages and even throw them like a rocket punch.  Nana can be seen as the exact opposite of Lucy. While Lucy\'s default personality is serious and cold, Nana\'s is friendly and kind; Lucy\'s split personality ""Nyu"" is similar to Nana\'s default while Nana sometimes goes into trances and acts cold like Lucy\'s default personality.

Kohta has repressed traumatic memories of witnessing the deaths of his father and sister, which later in the plot is revealed to be by Lucy\'s hand when she believes he\'s in love with Yuka and feels betrayed. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder brought on by the trauma of this event, caused him to end up in a psychiatric ward for over a year following the event. Due in part to his loss, Kohta is sympathetic towards girls in trouble and is extremely generous and protective to the girls around him, because he can relate to them and they remind him of his late younger sister, Kanae.  He meets Lucy in his childhood when she is burying her dead puppy and running away from the orphanage where she killed 4 children. In the anime, he was visiting his cousin with his family and decided to go to the mountain to draw, taking with him a music box he had recently purchased which plays Lilium. He strikes up a conversation with her when she apparently likes the song from the music box.

However, because both Nyu and Lucy share a body, he cannot bring himself to carry out his vengeance and instead offers her a peaceful life so long as she promises never to harm a human being again.  Although Lucy initially agrees, a chain of events lead to her instincts betraying her and Kohta once again mortally wounded. She almost destroys the world in her despair, but manages to subdue her violent instincts upon deciding to save his life in return for hers.

Although he had previously been tasked with killing all diclonius births, he falters when he must kill his own daughter. Lucy carries a deep hatred toward Kurama, stemming from his failure to save Aikon Takada (seen in the Elfen Lied OVA); however, she states that she will not kill him but will kill everything that loves him. It is revealed late in the series that the General Director of the diclonius research program kept his daughter alive, increasing Kurama's perceived debt to him. Kurama dies at the end of the anime after the explosives inside Mariko (whom he is cradling in his arms while walking away) are detonated at his command. It should be noted that right before the explosion, Kurama has a series of images flash in his mind. In them, his wife is still alive and Mariko is a normal baby, and together the images make up Kurama's idea of how life presumably would have played out if Mariko had been born normal (Mariko as a toddler, Mariko on her first day of school, etc.).  Kurama does not die in the manga; Mariko (worried about the safety of her father) confronts Lucy and clings to her as the bomb inside her detonates; this results in Lucy's horns being destroyed and turning back into Nyu, as well as Mariko's death.

When emotionally motivated, he is able to use his ki to increase his strength, speed, and reflexes in combat. Tamahome is also experienced in fencing thanks to being trained by Tokaki.    Initially, the story portrays Tamahome as a greedy young man, interested in helping others only if it means getting paid for it later. It is eventually revealed that his interest in accumulating money derives from trying to support his family. He comes across as cheerful, vain, and comic, but is actually shy and emotionally strong.

Extremely quick and agile, he particularly enjoys joking around with Nuriko, Tamahome, and Chichiri.

Tasuki&#039;s primary weapon is a flame throwing Tessen, an iron fan used for fighting which is eventually upgraded to become a diamond fan that could only be used by Tasuki by Taitsukun. Additionally, he is skilled in judo, archery, swordsmanship, and is briefly capable of using ofuda. As a Celestial Warrior, he possesses superhuman speed and known as Genrou or Huang-Lang (幻狼|&quot;Phantom Wolf&quot;) because of his wolf-like appearance.    At a young age Tasuki found his calling as a bandit when Hakurō, the chief bandit of Mount Reikaku, took him under his wing. He began to improve his martial arts abilities in hopes of living up to and carrying on the role of his mentor[2]. He and fellow bandit Kōji eventually master the use of an iron fan in combat. Tasuki first meets Miaka when he kidnaps her in order to regain his rightful place as the leader of Mount Reikaku&#039;s bandits. He eventually joins her in order to help the other Celestial Warriors on their quest, reluctantly leaving Kōji as the leader of the bandits of Mount Reikaku.

Of all the Suzaku Celestial Warriors, he takes the deaths of his comrades the hardest and openly cries for them. A running joke in the series is that Tasuki is afraid to swim, claiming that it is because he is a &quot;man of the mountains&quot;, though on several occasions he is able to instinctively tread water and finds unusual means of compensating for his weakness.    As the youngest and only son in a family with strong females and a weak father, Tasuki claims to hate women. But he demonstrates outstanding loyalty to Miaka and would die to protect her.

He also seems to be a quick thinker in the midst of combat, demonstrating the ability to find his enemies\' vulnerable points, quicker than most. He shows excellent use in all of the Gantz equipment, favoring the various guns, while occasionally using the Katana in which he shows great proficiency using. \nIn the beginning, he is a rather selfish character who often ends up being the reluctant hero. Unlike the rest, he has sense to take an x-gun home and test it out. In doing so, he figures out that the x-shotgun can lock onto multiple targets and fire at them all at once. \nOn his third mission, Kurono starts a relationship with a woman named Sei who she just meet with. Unfortunately, the mission is quite the disaster, and she dies, alongside Kato and all of the others members, leaving Kurono as the sole survivor. \nAt one point, Kurono actually enjoys the brutal missions, having a chance to prove his mettle and to use the power Gantz\'s technology grants him to decimate his foes, as well as to receive the admiration of his team members (such as Sei or Kishimoto). This ceases after the death of Kato, where he becomes frightened of the missions and hesitates to act as recklessly as he had in the past. Another deciding factor in Kurono\'s decision to prioritize brains over force is his growing attachment to Kojima Tae. He starts to believe that he must come back alive in order to be with her.!~\nAfter the events of Gantz Second Stage:\n\n~!Kurono is forced to go alone in his next mission, as a form of punishment by Gantz for throwing a tantrum and demanding his friends be resurrected. On this mission, his fourth, he manages to kill a large group of winged, child-like looking aliens, but one survives and kills almost all of Kurono\'s schoolmates as a form of revenge.\nKurono, the more experienced member of the team at the time after the Buddhist Temple mission, is eventually regarded as a hero by the other players who look up to him. He becomes the leader of the team and decides to take up the mantle of Kato\'s philosophy that everyone should come back alive, wich is ironic considering that Kato had tried to model himself after Kurono\'s younger self. In order to increase the survival of the Gantz Team members, Kurono holds regular meetings at his apartment where the team discusses missions and practice using the suits. These meetings appear to help greatly during the Oni mission as nearly all of the members survive in spite of the outstanding and powerful number of enemies. At the end of the mission, Kurono requests the revival of Kato and Nishi Joichiro.\nAfter the first mission of Phase 2,Kei is revived by Kato but remembers nothing beyond his choice to leave the game. Receiving the news from Nishi that the world will end in 1 week, Kei spends more time with his girlfriend Tae and is seen at the Tokyo Gantz team meeting with Nishi talking about the ""End of the World"" in 1 week\'s time.\n\nAs Kurono enjoys and wastes his last days together with Tae, Reika visits his apartment and confesses her love to him, asking to sleep with him. He rejects her saying he can\'t understand as to why she would have any feelings for him and tells her they are ""worlds apart"", mentioning that he is just a High school student and she is a celebrity. \n\nKurono and the team are sent to Italy where the final battle with the Roman aliens takes place. He and the rest of his team witnesses the amazing power of the Roman statue aliens as they break his and Kato\'s Gantz Sword with ease. Even with assistance from other Gantz Teams, some of Kurono\'s team members perish in combat. At the end of the mission, Kurono yells at Gantz for not resurrecting Suzuki after being requested to by Reika. He later calms down and leaves the room with everyone. Unknown to the others, then Reika comes back into the room, and ends up resurrecting a second Kurono instead of Suzuki, although unwillingly. The Kurono ""copy"" appears with his suit on and an Z-Gun in hand. \n\nAfter meeting the original Kurono, the copy decides to live with Reika. The original Kurono stays with Tae but both are separated when a new race of aliens invade and occupy the planet; Tae is abducted in the process. As the original Kurono searches for Tae, the copy assembles with other Gantz members from across the world who wish to save humanity from the aliens. During one of these fights, Reika dies while saving the copy, leaving him with a death wish; he dies when confronting the aliens responsible for the invasion and the Gantz network. The original Kurono manages to save Tae and a large group of humans from the invaders. However, the aliens demand to face Kurono, having labeled him as the strongest fighter on Earth. Kei by this point is skilled enough with the Gantz Sword to fight on par with and even injure the notoriously fast Eeva Gund, most likely the Katasrophe Aliens\' greatest warrior. This is a considerable feat, given the fact that Eeva doesn\'t seem to have been injured by anyone except from Kei.\nKurono accepts the challenge and thanks to Kato and his other allies, he succeeds in defeating the aliens\' champion.

He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke\'s disappearance and then her mother\'s death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother\'s advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ryū style dojo to become strong. The Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara Sōzō and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekihō Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shindō Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of Sōzō\'s death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded Sōzō pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself. Full of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname ""Zanza"" derived from his weapon, the zanbatō. Sanosuke\'s sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the Ōnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush. Hiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin\'s no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbatō broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc. At the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)', 'gender': None, 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Kenshin'}, 'description': '__Height:__ 158cm  \n\nKenshin Himura, also known throughout the anime as Hitokiri Battousai (Battousai the Manslayer) or Himura the Battousai, is the main character of the series Rurouni Kenshin.

Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and where about to kill him when Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning ""Heart of Sword,"" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.   \n\n~! However, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin\'s eyes.  Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it.  He left in the middle of his training and without his master\'s blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono.

Sasuke was involved in most of Yukimura's plots, but was ultimately left out of Yukimura's deception of the Mibu clan as Yukimura needed even Sasuke to believe he'd betrayed his friends in order for the Mibu to believe it as well.  Sasuke originally wielded a Muramasa blade which was physically identical to Kyo's Tenrou (one of the four masterpieces that Muramasa forged), but when that sword was cracked in a duel with Demon Eyes Kyo (a fight to determine who had the real Tenrou) he was given the Shibien - the oldest of Muramasa's Four Masterpieces. The Shibien blade, however, is exceptionally bloodthirsty and its creator, Muramasa, had to have it bound in chains to prevent it from turning on anyone. Strangely enough, it serves Sasuke obediently. Sasuke seems to have control over Lightning techniques. Sasuke possesses a technique called Raikoken that electrifies his sword. Thunder Fire calls a bolt of lightning down to strike an enemy. Thunder Flower Storm brings many lightning bolts down around Sasuke and his enemy.

Kyo was impressed with Akira\'s fighting spirit and adopted him, promising to make him the strongest man in the world - after Kyo, of course. He was nicknamed the Soutou no Ryuu for two reasons: one, because his techniques require two swords, called Chisakatana, and two, because of his two personalities. One moment he is docile, kind, and gentle, and in a flash, he is a blood-thirsty killer akin to Kyo himself.   Akira was incapable of unlocking his full potential because he didn\'t have samurai/noble blood, but he overcame this limitation by intentionally blinding himself.

In doing so, this would free Japan from the Mibu Clan's shadow governing and give Yukimura a chance at taking over Japan.  Yukimura is shadowed by a team of elite ninja called the Sanada Juuyuushi. His sword techniques are unnamed, but he uses the Sekireigan, which was taught to him by Anri. Yukimura can utilize the Sekireigan to access extreme speed, but Anri instructed him to never use it more than five times a day.

He is also notable for his treatment of his ninja followers, whom he cares about and respects deeply as members of his family. As a result, the Juuyuushi are not only loyal to him, but care about him personally.  Yukimura hates Ieyasu more than anything. It is interesting to note that historically, Yukimura had already fought Ieyasu's son, Hidetada (Benitora), at the battle of Ueda Castle.

He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed\'s primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a ""hero of the people"" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn\'t seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al\'s suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4\'11""), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed\'s ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\n~!Born to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward\'s first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad\'s formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi\'s intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the ""One is All, All is One"" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God\'s domain and peeking at the Gate\'s vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al\'s soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy\'s life.\n\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbells\' in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemists and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get his younger brother\'s body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up.

Hikaru means \'Light of the Lion Shrine\').   She is the smallest of the three knights, often mistaken for an elementary student and considered a bit tomboyish by her classmates. Despite her height, and her apparent naivete, she can be quite fierce and strong when the needs calls for it. Underneath her ever-present smiles and innocence, there lies a the spirit of a warrior who is determined to protect her friends and everyone\'s happiness even at the cost of her own. Because of this, as the series evolves, she is the one who is most affected - physically and mentally - by all the brutality and war around her. Nonetheless, Hikaru keeps a strong facade, trying not to worry Umi and Fuu who she considers her most precious friends, despite only having met them moments before being dragged into Cephiro. \n\nAs the true reasons for their summon come to light, and Hikaru is forced to act with Umi and Fuu to kill both Zagato and a grief-stricked Emeraude, her heart overflows with pain and self-hate and she unwittingly burns a shadow - Nova - across the surface of Cephiro before being transported back to Earth. During the second season, she is forced to battle her other self - Nova is vengeful and maliciously possessive of her, causing more heartache and troubles - and her own blooming feelings for Kail Lantis. At first, Hikaru approaches him, feeling guilty for the death of his brother, and begs him to hate only her, to hit only her but not to hurt Umi or Fuu. The moment Lantis tells her that she shouldn\'t blame herself, as it wasn\'t her fault but destiny, is most likely the moment when she starts falling for him. Without knowing it. \n\nThroughout the entire second season, she and Lantis are brought together many times, by circumstances, and it is not until Nova points out that she is very much in love with Lantis that Hikaru realizes it herself. After a grueling battle, in her own mind, to reforge the sword that Nova managed to break, Hikaru comes out victorious and, on the verge of blacking out in Lantis\'s arms, confesses to him that she loves him. She does not remember it after she wakes up but the feelings are still alive in her heart and Nova takes advantage of them time and time again. Despite the animosity between Cephiro and the three invading countries, she manages to befriend Eagle Vision of Autozam, making Eagle a sort of bridge between both his friends. At one point in the anime, Eagle and Hikaru both become candidates for the Pillar position but it is Hikaru who is chosen in the end and makes a wish to rid Cephiro of its oppressive system; wishing for Cephiro to be created by all those who love it.   \n\nIn the manga, Hikaru\'s feeling for Lantis is less mature and she likes both Lantis and Eagle Vision quite the same. When Lantis asked her in final chapter who she wants to marry, she answered, that she wants to marry him and Eagle.

As the series passes, her nobility is continuously tested, until she is finally forced to confront her own hypocrisy.  In the movie, Utena travels to Ohtori Academy after supposedly breaking up with her past boyfriend Touga. It is also assumed that after her seperation with Touga she was in an emotional turmoil that led her to the academy. However, she sees him on her first day on campus. Her hair is cut short, giving her more of a male\'s appearance, causing Saionji to initially mistake her for a boy. Additionally, Utena is a more bisexual character in the movie being coquettish with Wakaba and does not seem to mind her more boyish appearance. She is extremely troubled by Touga\'s apparent abandonment of her, and her interactions with Anthy express a level of introversion not present in the anime series, though she also shows an unpredictable streak and is once physically violent towards Anthy in anger. This is said by fans to be Utena\'s adoption of a more masculine personality. Initially Utena\'s aim to be a prince is more subtle than prominent compared to the anime series. It is Touga\'s supposed abandonment of her that caused her to feel that she must be more idependent and a ""prince"" by nature. Though she states that Touga was always the prince she wanted the movie deals with her own metamorphosis in becoming a prince. Many fans noted that Utena and Anthy seemingly swap personalities in the movie, and that Utena is the one who must be saved by Anthy.

Likewise, there is some indication that she has the ability to transform others as well (as in the episode, ""The Cowbell of Happiness"").!~\n~!According to the Adolescence of Utena manga, Anthy is in fact responsible for the dueling of which she is the prize. When her prince Dios (or Akio) died, she became reborn as the Rose Bride.

Her physical appearance is also changed, as she does not wear glasses and her hair is loose (similar to her appearance in the last few episodes of the anime). The design of her dress is also different, being mainly white. Anthy seemingly saves Utena by encouraging her to move past her vice (Touga) and seemingly rescues Utena in a subversion of the damsel in distress archetype.!~\n~!In the anime, she appears to be servile and obedient to all, especially her current Victor, whose every wishes she must cater to. Because of this, many Duelists believe that she lacks a personality and thoughts of her own, and she is treated badly by them. However, Anthy only pretends to be so in order to keep them in the Duels, and often enjoys subtly taking revenge on those around her.!~\n~!Both the anime and manga feature similar – but altogether different – circumstances wherein Anthy becomes the Rose Bride. In the movie, the world views her brother, Dios, as a prince. In reality, he is the tainted Lord of the Flies. He commits suicide when one of his most shameful secrets is revealed to Anthy, causing her to establish the Duels in order to find a replacement prince. Anthy later wholeheartedly accepts Utena as the prince she had been waiting for, but instead of staying, Utena decides that the two of them should travel to the world ""outside"" Ohtori where they will not be bound by the ideas of prince and princesses.!~\n~!In the anime, Dios is an actual prince who saves of the girls in the world on a daily basis. The work eventually weakens him to the point of death, but the world still demands his services. Anthy ends up facing an angry mob alone in order to protect him, and is stabbed by a million swords. The swords eventually take a life of their own, eternally thirsting for a prince\'s blood. To combat the pain, Anthy splits herself in two, and seals the part of her containing the swords beyond the Rose Gate, becoming the Rose Bride. This incident destroys Dios\' nobility and he is also split in two. One part of him becomes an altruistic but powerless ghost, while the other part becomes Akio. No longer a prince, Akio no longer has Dios\'s power, and establishes the Dueling Game to regain it. Anthy accepts her role as the Rose Bride despite the suffering it inflicts on her because she does not want to live in a world which had tortured her and her brother.!~\nAnthy appears to be an Asian Indian, possibly Tamil.

Utena does not remember much of this encounter, and for the most part Utena herself does not clearly remember the full details of her history, until the very end. !~ ~!In both the anime and manga, Utena accidentally becomes a Duelist and wins Anthy as the Rose Bride. Though critical of the Duels for objectifying Anthy, her honest desire to protect Anthy as a well as a drive to act like a prince lead her to become an active participant. As the series passes, her nobility is continuously tested, until she is finally forced to confront her own hypocrisy.  In the movie, Utena travels to Ohtori Academy after supposedly breaking up with her past boyfriend Touga. It is also assumed that after her seperation with Touga she was in an emotional turmoil that led her to the academy. However, she sees him on her first day on campus. Her hair is cut short, giving her more of a male\'s appearance, causing Saionji to initially mistake her for a boy. Additionally, Utena is a more bisexual character in the movie being coquettish with Wakaba and does not seem to mind her more boyish appearance. She is extremely troubled by Touga\'s apparent abandonment of her, and her interactions with Anthy express a level of introversion not present in the anime series, though she also shows an unpredictable streak and is once physically violent towards Anthy in anger. This is said by fans to be Utena\'s adoption of a more masculine personality. Initially Utena\'s aim to be a prince is more subtle than prominent compared to the anime series. It is Touga\'s supposed abandonment of her that caused her to feel that she must be more idependent and a ""prince"" by nature. Though she states that Touga was always the prince she wanted the movie deals with her own metamorphosis in becoming a prince. Many fans noted that Utena and Anthy seemingly swap personalities in the movie, and that Utena is the one who must be saved by Anthy. Their physical appearances also seem to mirror their respective series incarnations(seeing that Utena has wavy hair and Anthy has straight hair which was the opposite in the series).!~', 'gender': 'Female', 'modNotes': None}, {'name': {'first': 'Anthy'}, 'description': '__Height:__ 157 cm\n\nA mysterious and shy dark-skinned girl whose sometimes vapid expression and superficial politeness seem to mask something deeper. Many people project their wants or desires onto her, and she\'s often the target of their eventual rage or hate. Her ""doormat"" behavior belies a far more complex personality.\n\nAnthy appears to house the Sword of Dios within her own body. At the beginning of a duel, she slips into a trance and the Sword manifests, protruding from her chest so that her champion may draw it from her. This Sword is said to be a key to reaching the goal of Revolution, and in her position as the Rose Bride Anthy is said to be the key to obtaining it.\n~!Anthy exhibits other unusual abilities as well, including magically embellishing Utena\'s uniform before the duel. She seems to be able to completely alter her appearance, or at least induce others to see her for someone other than who she really is. Likewise, there is some indication that she has the ability to transform others as well (as in the episode, ""The Cowbell of Happiness"").!~\n~!According to the Adolescence of Utena manga, Anthy is in fact responsible for the dueling of which she is the prize. When her prince Dios (or Akio) died, she became reborn as the Rose Bride. When she took this role, the Dueling Arena appeared and the ""game"" was set in motion so another ""Prince"" could take Akio\'s place. In the anime series the duels are a strategic game set in motion to restore Akio\'s former powers and open the Gate of Revolution.!~\n~!In the movie, she seems happier and is much more sexually aggressive towards Utena. Her physical appearance is also changed, as she does not wear glasses and her hair is loose (similar to her appearance in the last few episodes of the anime). The design of her dress is also different, being mainly white. Anthy seemingly saves Utena by encouraging her to move past her vice (Touga) and seemingly rescues Utena in a subversion of the damsel in distress archetype.!~\n~!In the anime, she appears to be servile and obedient to all, especially her current Victor, whose every wishes she must cater to. Because of this, many Duelists believe that she lacks a personality and thoughts of her own, and she is treated badly by them. However, Anthy only pretends to be so in order to keep them in the Duels, and often enjoys subtly taking revenge on those around her.!~\n~!Both the anime and manga feature similar – but altogether different – circumstances wherein Anthy becomes the Rose Bride. In the movie, the world views her brother, Dios, as a prince. In reality, he is the tainted Lord of the Flies. He commits suicide when one of his most shameful secrets is revealed to Anthy, causing her to establish the Duels in order to find a replacement prince. Anthy later wholeheartedly accepts Utena as the prince she had been waiting for, but instead of staying, Utena decides that the two of them should travel to the world ""outside"" Ohtori where they will not be bound by the ideas of prince and princesses.!~\n~!In the anime, Dios is an actual prince who saves of the girls in the world on a daily basis. The work eventually weakens him to the point of death, but the world still demands his services. Anthy ends up facing an angry mob alone in order to protect him, and is stabbed by a million swords. The swords eventually take a life of their own, eternally thirsting for a prince\'s blood. To combat the pain, Anthy splits herself in two, and seals the part of her containing the swords beyond the Rose Gate, becoming the Rose Bride. This incident destroys Dios\' nobility and he is also split in two. One part of him becomes an altruistic but powerless ghost, while the other part becomes Akio. No longer a prince, Akio no longer has Dios\'s power, and establishes the Dueling Game to regain it. Anthy accepts her role as the Rose Bride despite the suffering it inflicts on her because she does not want to live in a world which had tortured her and her brother.!~\nAnthy appears to be an Asian Indian, possibly Tamil. She is noticeably darker than the other characters and wears a bindi mark or jewel.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)', 'gender': 'Female', 'modNotes': None}]}}"

One such trait was Obito\'s concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way Kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. Kakashi also inherits Obito\'s chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to Konoha\'s memorial site, where Obito\'s name is engraved. Ironically, this very habit is one that Kakashi was often annoyed at Obito about.

Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. \n\nThough he evasively says that he has ""many hobbies"" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of ""Icha Icha Paradise"" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally ""Make Out Paradise""), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, ""Icha Icha Violence"" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally ""Make Out Violence""). In Part II Naruto gives him the new ""Icha Icha Tactics"" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally ""Make Out Tactics"").  \n\nKakashi\'s Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent\'s movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi\'s use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison.

As a child, Soichiro was bullied and tormented because his family consists of demon exorcists, and were not well liked as a result. The apartment he shared with his mom was also covered in offensive messages. Soichiro started fighting early as a result, beating up those who tormented him. In elementary school, he met up with his best friend Bob Makihara, and they started calling themselves the Knuckle Bombs. The pair go to school beating up everyone they find until they have been proven the strongest. Upon arriving at Todo Academy, Soichiro quickly learns he is nowhere near as strong as he thought.    Soichiro fights using street fighting methods as opposed to real martial arts. He prides himself on being a thug and therefore he fights without honor, usually with cheap shots, etc... However, he does seem to draw line when it comes to hitting women. After training with Maya Natsume, he learns more martial arts moves including the Forged Needle attack. Throughout the Manga, it is shown that Soichiro and Aya Natsume have some sort of mental connection between them that calls to the other when they are in trouble.    Soichiro is a teen obsessed with fighting and takes a lot of pride in that. Ironically, he believes that fighting doesn&#039;t resolve anything, and fights more for fun than anything else. Initially, he is believed to have an average, or below average intelligence. He is very cocky and gets angered easily, and always has wise cracks. He isn&#039;t very good with being around girls, because he had little contact with them up until high school because they thought he was creepy. When he enrolled into Todo Academy, he fought Masataka Takayanagi resulting in him losing his first major fight. He falls in love with Maya Natsume, because she is similar to him. Through out the series, he repeatedly has shown he has trouble showing any affection towards people he cares about. Soichiro is slowly changing, and starting to become more intelligent and starting to build the charisma of a leader. For example, Soichiro actually gets Kagesada Sugano (almost solely referred to by his nickname asshat in the manga or scum in the anime) to once again become an active Juken Club member. Their initial encounter seems to inspire Kagesada to quit his typical cowardly behavior and fight. Soichiro also occasionally breaks the fourth wall. The two most notable instances of this are in chapter 3 when he states that he&#039;s supposed to be the &quot;hero&quot;, and in episode 24 of the anime when he refers to Masataka as a secondary character.    Aya is in love with him, but he seems uninterested because he is in love with Maya, although later on in the series he shows signs of liking or possibly loving her, not reacting so drastically when Aya shows her affections and trying to protect or comfort her (such as in chapter 109 when Soichiro, after Aya&#039;s fight with Hirohiko, goes to check on her because he is worried about her even though he won&#039;t admit it, which ends up in him receiving a kiss from her outside of the shower where they first met). Maya&#039;s feelings for Soichiro are unknown. Later on, Shizuru Kamura, she also develops a crush on Soichiro and views Maya as an enemy as a result.

Again, it is not truly specified if Kaguya is actually Kaguya-hime, or merely believes herself to be. In the legend, five princes ask for Kaguya-hime&#039;s hand in marriage. Not planning to marry any of them, Kaguya-hime sends each of them on a quest to retrieve five treasures- the basin of Buddha, a silver and gold alzalea, the Chinese Fire mouse (or fire rat, as in InuYasha&#039;s robe), a colored dragon jewel, and the seashore treasure of the swallows.    All the princes fail their task, and thus fail to win Kaguya-hime&#039;s favor. In the movie, these treasures are the key to releasing Kaguya from her mirror. They also represent wood, earth, fire, metal and water. In the movie, Kaguya desires the Celestial robe to gain the power of a celestial being in order to return to the moon. In the actual legend, Kaguya-hime returns to the moon after a set amount of time, claiming her time on earth was merely punishment for an unknown crime.

His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef ""Red Leg"" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. ~!He\'s also the third son of the Vinsmoke family.!~ Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his ""love-cook"" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname ""ero-cook"", or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around woman, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can\'t attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a ""strict upbringing"". To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.  Being the crew\'s chef, he looks out for the health of his crew mates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others\' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend.

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  \n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy\'s case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial ""D"".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades.

She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew.

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who\'s listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon ""Clima Tact."" \n\n Usopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions.

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  \n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy\'s case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial ""D"".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength.

His only display of true fear towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  \n\nLuffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Author Eiichiro Oda explains that it\'s not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  \n\nLuffy\'s dream is to find the One Piece and become King of the Pirates.

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand, and another in his mouth.

When in a serious fight he ties his normally, tied on the arm bandana, on his head.   \n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but unlike Robin he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.  Zoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he\'s a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master\'s code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics.

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. ~!Except a single fight where he uses knives against a fellow chef.!~ Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef ""Red Leg"" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. ~!He\'s also the third son of the Vinsmoke family.!~ Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his ""love-cook"" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname ""ero-cook"", or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around woman, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can\'t attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a ""strict upbringing"". To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.  Being the crew\'s chef, he looks out for the health of his crew mates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others\' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He\'s also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well.

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency) since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit\'s power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. Robin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.  Robin is actually an archaeologist of talent and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.  Robin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat\'s Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew.

Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model. This, combined with his naiveness, often causes him to imitate the other Straw Hats\' actions, no matter how obviously silly. Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun.

She first appears as a very standoffish, snotty young girl; however, exposure to Akari\'s mood begins to lighten her up as the series progresses. This does not stop her from telling the other girls to be quiet when they argue, however.  \n\nShe is just a trainee when Akari and Aika are apprentices, but is already showing a talent for rowing that might surpass both of them (in fact, this is the reason why she was scouted by Orange Planet despite her age). Despite this (and the fact that Akari and Aika are from rival businesses), she often joins the two in joint practice sessions, and she sincerely enjoys their company.  Alice speaks in a very deadpan manner, and tends to use the word dekkai (でっかい - meaning ""huge"") often in the course of speaking. Aika also commonly addresses her as ""Kohai-chan"" (後輩ちゃん - or ""junior"" said in a friendly manner). \n\n~!Of the three girls, Alice is actually the first to become a prima, efficiently sidestepping the single/journeyman status and earning herself the nickname ""Orange Princess"" (as seen above.) Alice not becoming a single might be because she was going to school, and because Orange Planet didn\'t want to burden her with the addition of potentially being able to take on customers when accompanied by a Prima, as she arguably had the talent to become a single even before she met Akari and Aika.

Akari often says ""Hohe"" or ""Hahi"", which is her short version of ""wow"".\n\nWhile she is not quite as skilled in rowing as Alice, nor is as familiar with the history of the city as Aika, her carefree and laid-back manner often endears her to the many people she encounters.
